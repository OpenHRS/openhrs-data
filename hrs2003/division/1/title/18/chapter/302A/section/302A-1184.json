However, where possible, the new century charter school is encouraged to use the provisions of chapter 103D; provided that the use of one or more provisions of chapter 103D shall not constitute a waiver of the exemption of chapter 103D and shall not subject the new century charter school to any other provision of chapter 103D.  New century charter schools shall account for funds expended for the procurement of goods and services, and this accounting shall be available to the public.  In addition, notwithstanding any law to the contrary, as public schools and entities of the State, new century public charter schools shall not bring suit against any other entity or agency of the State of Hawaii.
