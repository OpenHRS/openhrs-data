and 4 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This section states certain basic rules and presumptions of the bank collection process.\u00a0 One basic rule, appearing in the last sentence of subsection (1), is that, to the extent applicable, the provisions of the Article govern without regard to whether a bank handling an item owns the item or is an agent for collection.\u00a0 Historically, much time has been spent and effort expended in determining or attempting to determine whether a bank was a purchaser of an item or merely an agent for collection.\u00a0 See discussion of this subject and cases cited in 11 A.L.R. 1043, 16 A.L.R. 1084, 42 A.L.R. 92, 68 A.L.R. 725, 99 A.L.R. 486.\u00a0 See also Section 4 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\u00a0 The general approach of Article 4, similar to that of other articles, is to provide, within reasonable limits, rules or answers to major problems known to exist in the bank collection process without regard to questions of status and ownership but to keep general principles such as status and ownership available to cover residual areas not covered by specific rules.\u00a0 In line with this approach, the last sentence of subsection (1) says in effect that Article 4 applies to practically every item moving through banks for the purpose of presentment, payment or collection.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Within this general rule of broad coverage, the first two sentences of subsection (1) state a rule of status in terms of a strong presumption.\u00a0 \"Unless a contrary intent clearly appears\" the status of a collecting bank is that of an agent or sub-agent for the owner of the item.\u00a0 Although as indicated in Comment 1 it is much less important under Article 4 to determine status than has been the case heretofore, such status may have importance in some residual areas not covered by specific rules.\u00a0 Further, where status has been considered so important in the past, to omit all reference to it might cause confusion.\u00a0 The presumption of agency \"applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn\".\u00a0 Thus questions heretofore litigated as to whether ordinary indorsements \"for deposit\", \"for collection\" or in blank have the effect of creating an agency status or a purchase, no longer have significance in varying the prima facie rule of agency.\u00a0 Similarly, the nature of the credit given for an item or whether it is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn, do not rebut the general presumption.\u00a0 See A.L.R. references supra in Comment 1.\n\u00a0 A contrary intent can rebut the presumption but this must be clear.\u00a0 An example of a clear contrary intent would be if collateral papers established or the item bore a legend stating that the item was sold absolutely to the depositary bank.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The prima facie agency status of collecting banks is consistent with prevailing law and practice today.\u00a0 Section 2 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code so provides.\u00a0 Legends on deposit tickets, collection letters and acknowledgments of items and Federal Reserve operating letters consistently so provide.\u00a0 The status is consistent with rights of chargeback (Section 4-212 and Section 11 of the ABA Code) and risk of loss in the event of insolvency (Section 4-214 and Section 13 of the ABA Code).\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Affirmative statement of a prima facie agency status for collecting banks requires certain limitations and qualifications.\u00a0 Under current practices substantially all bank collections sooner or later merge into bank credits, at least if collection is effected.\u00a0 Usually, this takes place within a few days of the initiation of collection.\u00a0 An intermediary bank receives final collection and evidences the result of its collection by a \"credit\" on its books to the depositary bank.\u00a0 The depositary bank evidences the results of its collection by a \"credit\" in the account of its customer.\u00a0 As used in these instances the term \"credit\" clearly indicates a debtor-creditor relationship.\u00a0 At some stage in the bank collection process the agency status of a collecting bank changes to that of debtor, a debtor of its customer.\u00a0 Usually at about the same time it also becomes a creditor for the amount of the item, a creditor of some intermediary, payor or other bank.\u00a0 Thus the collection is completed, all agency aspects are terminated and the identity of the item has become completely merged in bank accounts, that of the customer with the depositary bank and that of one bank with another.\n\u00a0 Although Section 4-213(1) provides that an item is finally paid when the payor bank takes certain action with respect to the item such final payment of the item may or may not result in the simultaneous final settlement for the item in the case of all prior parties.\u00a0 If a series of provisional debits and credits for the item have been entered in accounts between banks, the final payment of the item by the payor bank may result in the automatic firming up of all these provisional debits and credits under Section 4-213(2), and the consequent receipt of final settlement for the item by each collecting bank and the customer of the depositary bank simultaneously with such action of the payor bank.\u00a0 However, if the payor bank or some intermediary bank accounts for the item with a remittance draft, the next prior bank usually does not receive final settlement for the item until such remittance draft finally clears.\u00a0 See Section 4-211(3)(a).\u00a0 The first sentence of subsection (1) provides that the agency status of a collecting bank (whether intermediary or depositary) continues until the settlement given by it for the item is or becomes final, referring to Sections 4-211(3), 4-212, and 4-213.\u00a0 In the case of the series of provisional credits covered by Section 4-213(2), this could be simultaneously with the final payment of the item by the payor bank.\u00a0 In cases where remittance drafts are used or in straight non-cash collections, this would not be until the times specified in Sections 4-211(3) and 4-213(3).\n\u00a0 A number of practical results flow from this rule continuing the agency status of a collecting bank until its settlement for the item is or becomes final, some of which are specifically set forth in this Article.\u00a0 One is that risk of loss continues in the owner of the item rather than the agent bank.\u00a0 See Section 4-212.\u00a0 Offsetting rights favorable to the owner are that pending such final settlement, the owner has the preference rights of Section 4-214 and the direct rights of Section 4-302 against the payor bank.\u00a0 It also follows from this rule that the dollar limitations of Federal Deposit Insurance are measured by the claim of the owner of the item rather than that of the collecting bank.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 In those cases where some period of time elapses between the final payment of the item by the payor bank and the time that the settlement of the collecting bank is or becomes final, e.g., where the payor bank or an intermediary bank accounts for the item with a remittance draft or in straight non-cash collections, the continuance of the agency status of the collecting bank necessarily carries with it the continuance of the owner's status as principal.\u00a0 The second sentence of subsection (1) provides that whatever rights the owner has to proceeds of the item are subject to the rights of collecting banks for outstanding advances on the item and other valid rights, if any.\u00a0 The rule provides a sound rule to govern cases of attempted attachment of proceeds of a non-cash item in the hands of the payor bank as property of the absent owner.\u00a0 If a collecting bank has made an advance on an item which is still outstanding, its right to obtain reimbursement for this advance should be superior to the rights of the owner to the proceeds or to the rights of a credit of the owner.\u00a0 The phrase \"other valid rights, if any\" is broad enough to cover legitimate rights of set-off of accounts between banks without attempting to provide that all set-offs may be valid.\u00a0 An intentional crediting of proceeds of an item to the account of a prior bank known to be insolvent, for the purpose of acquiring a right of set-off, would not produce a valid set-off.\u00a0 See 8 Zollman, Banks and Banking (1936) \u00a75443.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 This section and Article 4 as a whole represent an intentional abandonment of the approach to bank collection problems appearing in Section 4 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\u00a0 Where the tremendous volume of items handled makes impossible the examination by all banks of all indorsements on all items and where in fact this examination is not made, except perhaps by depositary banks, it is unrealistic to base the rights and duties of all banks in the collection chain on variations in the form of indorsements.\u00a0 It is anomalous to provide throughout the ABA Code that the prima facie status of collecting banks is that of agent or sub-agent but in Section 4 to provide that subsequent holders (sub-agents) shall have the right to rely on the presumption that the bank of deposit (the primary agent) is the owner of the item.\u00a0 It is unrealistic, particularly in this background, to base rights and duties on status of agent or owner.\u00a0 This Section 4-201 makes the pertinent provisions of Article 4 applicable to substantially all items handled by banks for presentment, payment or collection, recognizes the prima facie status of most banks as agents, and then seeks to state appropriate limits and some attributes to the general rules and presumptions so expressed.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Subsection (2) protects the ownership rights with respect to an item indorsed \"pay any bank or banker\" or in similar terms of a customer initiating collection or of any bank acquiring a security interest under Section 4-208, in the event the item is subsequently acquired under improper circumstances by a person who is not a bank and transferred by that person to another person, whether or not a bank.\u00a0 Upon return to the customer initiating collection of an item so indorsed, the indorsement may be cancelled (Section 3-208).\u00a0 A bank holding an item so indorsed may transfer the item out of banking channels by special indorsement; however, under Section 4-103(5), such bank would be liable to the owner of the item for any loss resulting therefrom if the transfer had been made in bad faith or with lack of ordinary care.\u00a0 If briefer and more simple forms of bank indorsements are developed under Section 4-206 (e.g., the use of bank transit numbers in lieu of present lengthy forms of bank indorsements), a depositary bank having the transit number \"X100\" could make subsection (2) operative by indorsements such as \"Pay any bank - X100\".\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-206, 3-208, 4-103, 4-206, 4-208, 4-212, 4-213, 4-214,
