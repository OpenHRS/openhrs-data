The commissioner or any authorized examiner shall thoroughly inspect and examine the captive insurance company's affairs to ascertain its financial condition, its ability to fulfill its obligations, and whether it has complied with this article.\n\t(b)  The powers, authorities, and duties relating to examinations vested in and imposed upon the commissioner under section 431:2-301 through section 431:2-307.5 of the code are extended to and imposed upon the commissioner in respect to examinations of captive insurance companies.\n\t(c)  All examination reports conducted by the commissioner, or a designated agent of the commissioner, of any pure captive insurance company shall remain confidential unless the commissioner determines that the pure captive insurance company is in an adverse financial condition and the commissioner reasonably believes that the interest of the public necessitates the opening of the information contained in the examination report for public inspection.\n\t(d)  Each branch captive insurance company shall file annually with the commissioner a certificate of compliance issued by the insurance regulatory authority of the jurisdiction in which the outside captive insurance company of the branch captive insurance company is domiciled along with certified copies of any examination reports conducted of the outside captive insurance company by its domiciliary insurance regulator during the preceding calendar year.  These filings shall be made with the commissioner by March 1 of each year.  So long as the branch captive insurance company complies with the requirements of this subsection, and unless otherwise deemed necessary by the commissioner, any examination of the branch captive insurance company under this subsection shall be only with respect to the business underwritten by the branch captive insurance company in this State.  If necessary, however, the commissioner may examine the outside captive insurance company of any branch captive insurance company licensed under this article.
