[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-326; HRS \u00a7490:2-326; am L 2000, c 241, \u00a713]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 19(3), Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Completely rewritten in this and the succeeding section.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 A \"sale on approval\" or \"sale or return\" is distinct from other types of transactions with which they have frequently been confused.\u00a0 The type of \"sale on approval,\" \"on trial\" or \"on satisfaction\" dealt with involves a contract under which the seller undertakes a particular business risk to satisfy his prospective buyer with the appearance or performance of the goods in question. \u00a0The goods are delivered to the proposed purchaser but they remain the property of the seller until the buyer accepts them.\u00a0 The price has already been agreed.\u00a0 The buyer's willingness to receive and test the goods is the consideration for the seller's engagement to deliver and sell.\u00a0 The type of \"sale or return\" involved herein is a sale to a merchant whose unwillingness to buy is overcome only by the seller's engagement to take back the goods (or any commercial unit of goods) in lieu of payment if they fail to be resold.\u00a0 These two transactions are so strongly delineated in practice and in general understanding that every presumption runs against a delivery to a consumer being a \"sale or return\" and against a delivery to a merchant for resale being a \"sale on approval.\"\n\u00a0 The right to return the goods for failure to conform to the contract does not make the transaction a \"sale on approval\" or \"sale or return\" and has nothing to do with this and the following section.\u00a0 The present section is not concerned with remedies for breach of contract.\u00a0 It deals instead with a power given by the contract to turn back the goods even though they are wholly as warranted.\n\u00a0 This section nevertheless presupposes that a contract for sale is contemplated by the parties although that contract may be of the peculiar character here described.\n\u00a0 Where the buyer's obligation as a buyer is conditioned not on his personal approval but on the article's passing a described objective test, the risk of loss by casualty pending the test is properly the seller's and proper return is at his expense.\u00a0 On the point of \"satisfaction\" as meaning \"reasonable satisfaction\" where an industrial machine is involved, this Article takes no position.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Pursuant to the general policies of this Act which require good faith not only between the parties to the sales contract, but as against interested third parties, subsection (3) resolves all reasonable doubts as to the nature of the transaction in favor of the general creditors of the buyer.\u00a0 As against such creditors words such as \"on consignment\" or \"on memorandum\", with or without words of reservation of title in the seller, are disregarded when the buyer has a place of business at which he deals in goods of the kind involved.\u00a0 A necessary exception is made where the buyer is known to be engaged primarily in selling the goods of others or is selling under a relevant sign law, or the seller complies with the filing provisions of Article 9 as if his interest were a security interest.\u00a0 However, there is no intent in this Section to narrow the protection afforded to third parties in any jurisdiction which has a selling Factors Act.\u00a0 The purpose of the exception is merely to limit the effect of the present subsection itself, in the absence of any such Factors Act, to cases in which creditors of the buyer may reasonably be deemed to have been misled by the secret reservation.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (4) resolves a conflict in the pre-existing case law by recognition that an \"or return\" provision is so definitely at odds with any ordinary contract for sale of goods that where written agreements are involved it must be contained in a written memorandum.\u00a0 The \"or return\" aspect of a sales contract must be treated as a separate contract under the Statute of Frauds section and as contradicting the sale insofar as questions of parol or extrinsic evidence are concerned.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Article 9.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 2-201 and 2-202.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Between merchants\".\u00a0 Section 2-104.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Creditor\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
