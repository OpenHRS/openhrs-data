    "text": "(a)\u00a0 Prior to submitting proposed rules for adoption, amendment, or repeal under section 91-3, the agency shall determine whether the proposed rules affect small business, and if so, the availability and practicability of less restrictive alternatives that could be implemented.\u00a0 This section shall not apply to emergency rulemaking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 If the proposed rules affect small business, the agency shall consider creative, innovative, or flexible methods of compliance for small businesses and prepare a small business impact statement to be submitted with the proposed rules to the departmental advisory committee on small business and the board when the rules are essentially complete and before the rules are submitted to the governor for approval for public hearing.\u00a0 The statement shall provide a reasonable determination of the following:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The businesses that will be directly affected by, bear the costs of, or directly benefit from the proposed rules;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Description of the small businesses that will be required to comply with the proposed rules and how they may be adversely affected;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 In dollar amounts, the increase in the level of direct costs such as fees or fines, and indirect costs such as reporting, recordkeeping, equipment, construction, labor, professional services, revenue loss, or other costs associated with compliance;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 The probable monetary costs and benefits to the implementing agency and other agencies directly affected, including the estimated total amount the agency expects to collect from any additionally imposed fees and the manner in which the moneys will be used;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The methods the agency considered or used to reduce the impact on small business such as consolidation, simplification, differing compliance or reporting requirements, less stringent deadlines, modification of the fines schedule, performance rather than design standards, exemption, or any other mitigating techniques;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 How the agency involved small business in the development of the proposed rules; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 Whether the proposed rules include provisions that are more stringent than those mandated by any comparable or related federal, state, or county standards, with an explanation of the reason for imposing the more stringent standard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 This chapter shall not apply to proposed rules adopted by an agency to implement a statute or ordinance that does not require an agency to interpret or describe the requirements of the statute or ordinance, such as federally-mandated regulations that afford the agency no discretion to consider less restrictive alternatives.
