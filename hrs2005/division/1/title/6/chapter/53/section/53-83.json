However, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be subject to the following:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe county shall exercise such powers in its own name and shall not be required to use the words \"redevelopment agency\" in such exercise.\n\t(2)\tThe provisions of section 53-2, being inappropriate where the county directly carries out the purposes of this chapter, shall not be applicable.\n\t(3)\tThe provisions of section 53-3 shall apply to the members of the council and to the elected and appointed officials and the employees of the county administering or performing the functions of the county under this part or responsible for such administration or performance.\n\t(4)\tThe provisions of section 53-4 shall not be applicable to the county.

The county may provide for payments to the county in lieu of taxes or for the supplying by the county of governmental services.\n\t(12)\tBorrowings by the county pursuant to section 53-15 and the issuance by the county of bonds pursuant to section 53-16 shall be subject to the provisions of section 53-84.\n\t(13)\tThe provisions of section 53-18 shall not be applicable.  In lieu thereof any funds of the county arising out of the exercise of its functions under this part shall be invested in accordance with the provisions of law applicable to the investment of other moneys of the county.\n\t(14)\tThe provisions of section 53-19 shall not be applicable.  In lieu thereof the county shall include in its annual financial report a report of its receipts, expenditures and activities under this chapter for the year to which such annual report pertains, and shall include in its annual budget or budgets its proposed program under this chapter and the estimated cost thereof for the year to which such budget or budgets pertain.\n\t(15)\tThe approval by the council of any plan or project authorized in section 53-20 shall not require any concurrency, including by the officer or department administering or performing the functions of the county under this part.\n\t(16)\tThe provisions of [subsection] (b) of section 53-22 shall be inapplicable; provided that nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to prohibit the county from advancing for the purposes of this part moneys other than redevelopment moneys or funds, or from reimbursing itself from redevelopment moneys or funds so advanced, or from issuing its bonds as provided in this part.\n\t(17)\tThe words the \"agency, the county\" where used in the second sentence of section 53-53 shall mean and refer to the county.\n\t(18)\tThe second sentence of section 53-54 shall be construed as meaning that the county may delegate to any other public body any of the powers or functions of the county with respect to the planning or undertaking of an urban renewal project in the area in which such public body is authorized to act, and such other public body may carry out or perform such powers or functions for the county.
