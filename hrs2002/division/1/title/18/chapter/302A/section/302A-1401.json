Federal Funding\n []    (a)  The board, designated as the administrators of such funds as may be allotted to the State under federal legislation for public educational purposes, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by congressional action, shall use and expend the funds:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tTo improve the program of the public schools of the State, including any grades up to the fourteenth grade or such lower grade as shall be prescribed as a maximum for such purposes by the Act of Congress concerned, by expanding the educational offerings, particularly in the rural districts;\n\t(2)\tFor the payment of salaries to teachers;\n\t(3)\tTo employ additional teachers to relieve overcrowded classes;\n\t(4)\tTo adjust the salaries of teachers to meet the increased cost of living, within such limits as may be fixed by, and pursuant to, state law;\n\t(5)\tTo provide for the purchase of supplies, apparatus, and materials for the public schools; and\n\t(6)\tFor any of such purposes and to such extent as shall be permitted by the Acts of Congress concerned.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  The board shall organize and conduct a program of public pregrade education to the extent that funds provided therefor by the United States government are, or from time to time may become, available.  In establishing and carrying on the pregrade education, any such federal funds shall be expended during any school year as nearly as practicable in each of the school supervisory districts of the State in the proportion that the number of inhabitants of each district of less than six years of age bears to the total number of the inhabitants of the entire State within the age limits, as shown by the latest report of the department of health preceding the opening of the school year.
