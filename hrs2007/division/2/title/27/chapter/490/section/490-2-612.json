    "text": "(1)\u00a0 An \"installment contract\" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause \"each delivery is a separate contract\" or its equivalent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole.\u00a0 But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.

the buyer's obligation reaches only to cooperation.\u00a0 Adequate assurance for purposes of subsection (2) is measured by the same standards as under the section on right to adequate assurance of performance.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Subsection (3) is designed to further the continuance of the contract in the absence of an overt cancellation.\u00a0 The question arising when an action is brought as to a single installment only is resolved by making such action waive the right of cancellation.\u00a0 This involves merely a defect in one or more installments, as contrasted with the situation where there is a true repudiation within the section on anticipatory repudiation.\u00a0 Whether the non-conformity in any given installment justifies cancellation as to the future depends, not on whether such non-conformity indicates an intent or likelihood that the future deliveries will also be defective, but whether the non- conformity substantially impairs the value of the whole contract.\u00a0 If only the seller's security in regard to future installments is impaired, he has the right to demand adequate assurances of proper future performance but has not an immediate right to cancel the entire contract.\u00a0 It is clear under this Article, however, that defects in prior installments are cumulative in effect, so that acceptance does not wash out the defect \"waived.\"\u00a0 Prior policy is continued, putting the rule as to buyer's default on the same footing as that in regard to seller's default.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Under the requirement of seasonable notification of cancellation under subsection (3), a buyer who accepts a non-conforming installment which substantially impairs the value of the entire contract should properly be permitted to withhold his decision as to whether or not to cancel pending a response from the seller as to his claim for cure or adjustment.\u00a0 Similarly, a seller may withhold a delivery pending payment for prior ones, at the same time delaying his decision as to cancellation.\u00a0 A reasonable time for notifying of cancellation, judged by commercial standards under the section on good faith, extends of course to include the time covered by any reasonable negotiation in good faith.\u00a0 However, during this period the defaulting party is entitled, on request, to know whether the contract is still in effect, before he can be required to perform further.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 2-307 and 2-607.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Section 1-203.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Sections 2-208 and 2-609.\n\u00a0 Point 6:\u00a0 Section 2-610.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Action\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Aggrieved party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Cancellation\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Lot\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notifies\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seasonably\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
