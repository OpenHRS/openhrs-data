    "text": "(1)  In any prosecution, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant engaged in the prohibited conduct or caused the prohibited result because the defendant was induced or encouraged to do so by a law enforcement officer, or by a person acting in cooperation with a law enforcement officer, who, for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, either:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tKnowingly made false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct or result was not prohibited; or\n\t(b)\tEmployed methods of persuasion or inducement which created a substantial risk that the offense would be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.\n\n\n\n\t(2)  The defense afforded by this section is unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the offense charged and the prosecution is based on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the person perpetrating the entrapment.
