    "text": "(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tA parcel of the public lands within an industrial park which had been occupied and used under a permit on the day before the date of designation of that industrial park shall be an economic unit in that industrial park.  For the purpose of this section:\n\n\t\t(A)\t\"Date of designation\" means the effective date of the resolution or law which designates an industrial park; and\n\t\t(B)\t\"Eligible economic unit\" means an economic unit referred to under this paragraph;\n\n\t(2)\tA person with a permit to use an eligible economic unit on the day before the date of designation of that industrial park shall be given first preference to lease that unit after the date of designation if the person is an eligible lessee.  For the purpose of this section, an \"eligible permittee\" means a person referred to under this paragraph;\n\t(3)\tThe board shall issue a lease to an eligible permittee for an eligible economic unit under mutually agreeable terms, conditions, and lease rent.  The lease shall be issued through negotiations, without regard to the limitations set forth in section 171-16(c) and section 171-59(a).  The terms, conditions, and rent under the lease shall be in conformance with this chapter, and the board shall include lease covenants in each lease for the placement and construction of improvements in accordance with minimum standards established by applicable county building codes;\n\t(4)\tThe board shall negotiate in good faith with each eligible permittee.  If the board and eligible permittee cannot agree to a lease within one hundred eighty days from the date of designation, the board shall have no further obligation to negotiate with or issue a lease to the eligible permittee and may issue a lease for the eligible economic unit to another person after the one hundred eighty-day period; provided that any lease for the eligible economic unit issued subsequent to the termination of the one hundred eighty-day period shall not include terms and conditions which are less restrictive, and a lease rent which is less, than the terms, conditions, and lease rent last offered in writing by the eligible permittee and received by the board; and\n\t(5)\tThe board, in lieu of issuing a lease under paragraph (3), may issue a master lease to a corporation whose members or shareholders shall be either eligible permittees or eligible sublessees of the industrial park, through negotiations and without regard to the limitations provided in section 171-16(c) and section 171-59(a).  The master lease shall provide for the issuance of subleases to eligible permittees and other sublessees approved by the board, on terms and conditions approved by the board.  The terms and conditions of a master lease concerning the authority to sublease shall supersede any contrary term or condition in a development agreement executed prior to the issuance of the master lease; provided that all other terms and conditions of the development agreement shall be incorporated and made a part of the master lease.  All terms, conditions, and rents under the master lease and subleases shall be in conformance with this chapter, and the board shall include lease covenants in the master lease and each sublease for the placement and construction of improvements in accordance with minimum standards established by applicable county building codes.  The lessee under the master lease shall assume the responsibility of administering and monitoring permittee compliance with all sublease obligations.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  It is the intent of the legislature that persons occupying and using under a month-to-month or revocable permit public lands which have been designated as part of an industrial park be given the opportunity to lease the same public lands occupied and used prior to the designation.  The application, construction, and interpretation of this section shall reflect this intent. [L 1988, c 361, pt of \u00a71; am L 1991, c 173, \u00a74; am L 2002, c 139, \u00a73]"
