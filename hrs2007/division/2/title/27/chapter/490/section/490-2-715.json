[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-715; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) - Sections 69(7) and 70, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes and New\nMatter:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) is intended to provide reimbursement for the buyer who incurs reasonable expenses in connection with the handling of rightfully rejected goods or goods whose acceptance may be justifiably revoked, or in connection with effecting cover where the breach of the contract lies in non-conformity or non- delivery of the goods.\u00a0 The incidental damages listed are not intended to be exhaustive but are merely illustrative of the typical kinds of incidental damage.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (2) operates to allow the buyer, in an appropriate case, any consequential damages which are the result of the seller's breach.\u00a0 The \"tacit agreement\" test for the recovery of consequential damages is rejected.\u00a0 Although the older rule at common law which made the seller liable for all consequential damages of which he had \"reason to know\" in advance is followed, the liberality of that rule is modified by refusing to permit recovery unless the buyer could not reasonably have prevented the loss by cover or otherwise.\u00a0 Subparagraph (2) carries forward the provisions of the prior uniform statutory provision as to consequential damages resulting from breach of warranty, but modifies the rule by requiring first that the buyer attempt to minimize his damages in good faith, either by cover or otherwise.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 In the absence of excuse under the section on merchant's excuse by failure of presupposed conditions, the seller is liable for consequential damages in all cases where he had reason to know of the buyer's general or particular requirements at the time of contracting.\u00a0 It is not necessary that there be a conscious acceptance of an insurer's liability on the seller's part, nor is his obligation for consequential damages limited to cases in which he fails to use due effort in good faith.\n\u00a0 Particular needs of the buyer must generally be made known to the seller while general needs must rarely be made known to charge the seller with knowledge.\n\u00a0 Any seller who does not wish to take the risk of consequential damages has available the section on contractual limitation of remedy.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The burden of proving the extent of loss incurred by way of consequential damage is on the buyer, but the section on liberal administration of remedies rejects any doctrine of certainty which requires almost mathematical precision in the proof of loss.\u00a0 Loss may be determined in any manner which is reasonable under the circumstances.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(b) states the usual rule as to breach of warranty, allowing recovery for injuries \"proximately\" resulting from the breach.\u00a0 Where the injury involved follows the use of goods without discovery of the defect causing the damage, the question of \"proximate\" cause turns on whether it was reasonable for the buyer to use the goods without such inspection as would have revealed the defects.\u00a0 If it was not reasonable for him to do so, or if he did in fact discover the defect prior to his use, the injury would not proximately result from the breach of warranty.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 In the case of sale of wares to one in the business of reselling them, resale is one of the requirements of which the seller has reason to know within the meaning of subsection (2)(a).\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 2-608.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 1-203, 2-615 and 2-719.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Section 1-106.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Cover\".\u00a0 Section 2-712.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Person\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Receipt\" of goods.\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
