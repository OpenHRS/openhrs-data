The license shall be valid only for a period of eighteen months from the date of issuance.  The board shall establish guidelines to determine a locality with an absence or shortage of physicians.

A limited and temporary license issued hereunder shall only be valid for the practice of medicine and surgery while the applicant is in the employ of such governmental agency or department and in no case shall be used to provide private patient care for a fee.  A license issued under this paragraph may be renewed from year to year;\n\t(3)\tThe applicant would practice medicine and surgery only while under the direction of a physician regularly licensed in the State other than as permitted by this section, and that the applicant intends to take the regular licensing examination conducted by the board within the next eighteen months.  A limited and temporary license issued under this paragraph shall be valid for no more than eighteen months from the date of issuance, unless otherwise extended at the discretion of the board of medical examiners; provided that this discretionary extension shall not exceed a period of six months beyond the original expiration date of the limited and temporary license;\n\t(4)\tThe applicant has been appointed as a resident or accepted for specialty training in a health care facility or organized ambulatory health care facility as defined in section 323D-2 or a hospital approved by the board, and that the applicant shall be limited in the practice of medicine and surgery to the extent required by the duties of the applicant's position or by the program of training while at the health care facility, organized ambulatory health care facility, or hospital.  The license shall be valid during the period in which the applicant remains as a resident in training, and may be renewed from year to year during the period; or\n\t(5)\tA public emergency exists, and that the applicant has been duly licensed as a physician by written examination under the laws of another state or territory of the United States.  A limited and temporary license issued hereunder shall only be valid for the period of such public emergency.\n\n\n\n\tNothing herein requires the registration or licensing hereunder of nurses, or other similar persons, acting under the direction and control of a licensed physician.
