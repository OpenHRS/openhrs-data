    "text": "(a)  Every health club contract may be canceled, if by reason of death or disability the buyer is unable to receive all services as contracted.  If the inability to receive all services as contracted is due to disability, the buyer shall have the option of extending the duration of the original contract at no cost for a period equal to the duration of the disability. \n\t(b)  Every health club contract shall fully disclose the buyer's right of cancellation in the event of death or disability, and the option to extend the duration of the health club contract in the event of disability. \n\t(c)  The health club shall have the right to require and verify reasonable evidence of disability or death. \n\t(d)  In the event of cancellation due to death or disability, the health club shall immediately refund to the buyer or the buyer's estate, the entire consideration the buyer paid for the health club contract, less an amount computed by dividing the total contract price by the number of weeks in the term of the contract and multiplying the result by the number of weeks elapsed at the time of death or disability. \n\t(e)  \"Disability\", as used in this section, means a condition which has existed for more than thirty days which precludes the buyer from using the facilities or services of the health club, and the condition is verified by a doctor legally authorized to practice medicine or osteopathy in the State.
