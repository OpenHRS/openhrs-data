In evaluating the expected loss ratio due consideration shall be given to all relevant factors, including:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tStatistical credibility of incurred claims experience and earned premiums;\n\t(2)\tThe period for which rates are computed to provide coverage;\n\t(3)\tExperienced and projected trends;\n\t(4)\tConcentration of experience within early policy duration;\n\t(5)\tExpected claim fluctuation;\n\t(6)\tExperience refunds, adjustments, or dividends;\n\t(7)\tRenewability features;\n\t(8)\tAll appropriate expense factors;\n\t(9)\tInterest;\n\t(10)\tExperimental nature of the coverage;\n\t(11)\tPolicy reserves; \n\t(12)\tMix of business by risk classification, if applicable; and\n\t(13)\tProduct features such as long elimination periods, high deductibles, and high maximum limits.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  For purposes of this section, the commissioner shall consult with a qualified long-term care actuary.\n\t(c)  Subsection (a) shall not apply to life insurance policies that accelerate benefits for long-term care.  A life insurance policy that funds long-term care benefits entirely by accelerating the death benefit is considered to provide reasonable benefits in relation to premiums paid, if the policy complies with all of the following provisions:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe interest credited internally to determine cash value accumulations, including long-term care, if any, are guaranteed not to be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate for cash value accumulations without long-term care set forth in the policy;\n\t(2)\tThe portion of the policy that provides life insurance benefits meets the nonforfeiture requirements for life insurance;\n\t(3)\tThe policy meets the disclosure requirements of section 431:10H-114 as applicable;\n\t(4)\tAny policy illustration that meets the applicable requirements for policy illustration;\n\t(5)\tAn actuarial memorandum is filed with the insurance division that includes:\n\n\t\t(A)\tA description of the basis on which the long-term care rates were determined;\n\t\t(B)\tA description of the basis for the reserves;\n\t\t(C)\tA summary of the type of policy, benefits, renewability, general marketing method, and limits on ages of issuance;\n\t\t(D)\tA description and a table of each actuarial assumption used.  For expenses, an insurer shall include per cent of premium dollars per policy and dollars per unit of benefits, if any;\n\t\t(E)\tA description and a table of the anticipated policy reserves and additional reserves to be held in each future year for active lives;\n\t\t(F)\tThe estimated average annual premium per policy and the average issue age;\n\t\t(G)\tA statement as to whether underwriting is performed at the time of application.  The statement shall indicate whether underwriting is used, and if used, the statement shall include a description of the type or types of underwriting used such as medical underwriting or functional assessment underwriting.  Concerning a group policy, the statement shall indicate whether the enrollee or any dependent will be underwritten and when underwriting occurs; and\n\t\t(H)\tA description of the effect of the long-term care policy provision on the required premiums, nonforfeiture values and reserves on the underlying life insurance policy, both for active lives and those in long-term care claim status.
