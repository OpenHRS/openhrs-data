    "name": "Termination of appointment of guardian of the person; general",
    "number": "5-210",
    "text": "A guardian of the person's authority and responsibility terminates upon the death, resignation or removal of the guardian or upon the minor's death, adoption, marriage or attainment of majority, but termination does not affect the guardian's liability for prior acts, nor the guardian's obligation to account for funds and assets of the guardian's ward.  Resignation of a guardian of the person does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the family court. [L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985]"
