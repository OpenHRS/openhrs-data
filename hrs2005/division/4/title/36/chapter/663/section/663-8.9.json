[L Sp 1986, c 2, \u00a722]\nCase Notes\n  Because a corpse is neither \"property\" nor a \"material object\" for purposes of this section, this section does not apply to negligent infliction of emotional distress claims arising from the negligent mishandling of a corpse.  96 H. 147, 28 P.3d 982.\n  Cited:  895 F. Supp. 1365.\n  Mentioned:  900 F. Supp. 1339."
