The conditions may include the furnishing of a bond in a reasonable amount, to be fixed by the court, to insure compliance with other conditions or to indemnify the director of finance and any other person in the event it is thereafter held or found that the registration was wrongful.

A copy of the court's order as to the conditional registration shall be served upon the director of finance and retained in the file relating to the registration, and shall constitute notice to the world of the condition therein stated, provided the certificate of registration contains a notation of conditional registration as hereinabove provided.
