and\n\t\t(C)\tThe estimated residual value of the property at the expiration of the initial term of the lease;\n\n\t(5)\tThe maximum lease term during which the lessor financial institution must recover the lessor's full investment in the property, plus the estimated total cost of financing the property, shall be forty years; and\n\t(6)\tAt the expiration of the lease (including any renewals or extensions with the same lessee), all interest in the property shall be either liquidated or leased again on a nonoperating basis as soon as practicable (in no event later than two years from the expiration of the lease), but in no case shall the lessor retain any interest in the property beyond fifty years after the lessor's acquisition of the property.
