    "text": "A child may be exempted from the required immunizations:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIf a licensed physician certifies that the physical condition of the child is such that immunizations would endanger the child's life or health; or\n\t(2)\tIf any parent, custodian, guardian, or any other person in loco parentis to a child objects to immunization in writing on the grounds that the immunization conflicts with that person's bona fide religious tenets and practices.  Upon showing the appropriate school official satisfactory evidence of the exemption, no certificate or other evidence of immunization shall be required for entry into school.
