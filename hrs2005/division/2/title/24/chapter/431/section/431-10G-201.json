Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both.  The standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  Except to the extent necessary to meet the provisions of subsection (a)(4), uniformity among insurers in any matters within the scope of this section is neither required nor prohibited.\n\t(c)  After June 7, 1989, each insurer of a motorcycle or motor scooter shall provide a fifteen per cent reduction off premium charges each insurer assesses for each new and renewal policy for liability coverage issued pursuant to this article if the applicant has successfully completed a motorcycle education course approved by the department of transportation.
