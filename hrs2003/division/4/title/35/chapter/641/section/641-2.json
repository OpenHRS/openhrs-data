It may enter an amended or modified judgment, order, or decree, or may remand the case to the trial court for the entry of the same or for other or further proceedings, as in its opinion the facts and law warrant.  Any judgment, order or decree entered by the supreme court may be enforced by it or remitted for enforcement by the trial court.\n\tEvery appeal shall be taken on the record and no new evidence shall be introduced in the supreme court.
