provided that such course of conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The district courts shall have power to enjoin or prohibit or temporarily restrain harassment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 Any person who has been subjected to harassment may petition the district court of the district in which the petitioner resides for a temporary restraining order and an injunction from further harassment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 A petition for relief from harassment shall be in writing and shall allege that a past act or acts of harassment may have occurred, or that threats of harassment make it probable that acts of harassment may be imminent; and shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath or statement made under penalty of perjury stating the specific facts and circumstances from which relief is sought.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 Upon petition to a district court under this section, the court may temporarily restrain the person or persons named in the petition from harassing the petitioner upon a determination that there is probable cause to believe that a past act or acts of harassment have occurred or that a threat or threats of harassment may be imminent.\u00a0 The court may issue an ex parte temporary restraining order either in writing or orally; provided that oral orders shall be reduced to writing by the close of the next court day following oral issuance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 A temporary restraining order that is granted under this section shall remain in effect at the discretion of the court for a period not to exceed ninety days from the date the order is granted.\u00a0 A hearing on the petition to enjoin harassment shall be held within fifteen days after the temporary restraining order is granted.\u00a0 In the event that service of the temporary restraining order has not been effected before the date of the hearing on the petition to enjoin, the court may set a new date for the hearing; provided that the new date shall not exceed ninety days from the date the temporary restraining order was granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties named in the petition may file or give oral responses explaining, excusing, justifying, or denying the alleged act or acts of harassment.\u00a0 The court shall receive all evidence that is relevant at the hearing, and may make independent inquiry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that harassment as defined in paragraph (1) of that definition exists, it may enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of the petitioner, or that harassment as defined in paragraph (2) of that definition exists, it shall enjoin for no more than three years further harassment of the petitioner; provided that this paragraph shall not prohibit the court from issuing other injunctions against the named parties even if the time to which the injunction applies exceeds a total of three years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any order issued under this section shall be served upon the respondent.\u00a0 For the purposes of this section, \"served\" shall mean actual personal service, service by certified mail, or proof that the respondent was present at the hearing in which the court orally issued the injunction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where service of a restraining order or injunction has been made or where the respondent is deemed to have received notice of a restraining order or injunction order, any knowing or intentional violation of the restraining order or injunction order shall subject the respondent to the provisions in subsection (h).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any order issued shall be transmitted to the chief of police of the county in which the order is issued by way of regular mail, facsimile transmission, or other similar means of transmission.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 The court may grant the prevailing party in an action brought under this section, costs and fees, including attorney's fees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 A knowing or intentional violation of a restraining order or injunction issued pursuant to this section is a misdemeanor.\u00a0 The court shall sentence a violator to appropriate counseling and shall sentence a person convicted under this section as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 For a violation of an injunction or restraining order that occurs after a conviction for a violation of the same injunction or restraining order, a violator shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum jail sentence of not less than forty-eight hours;
