Neal, 3 Burr. 1354 (1762), and related principles.\u00a0 See Comment to Section 3-417.\u00a0 Thus collecting banks are given not only all the warranties given to payors by subsection (1), without those exceptions, but also the (d) and (e) warranties of subsection (2).\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The last sentence of subsection (3) provides that damages for breach of warranties or the engagement to honor shall not exceed the consideration received by the customer or collecting bank responsible \"plus finance charges and expenses related to the item, if any\".\u00a0 The \"expenses\" referred to in this phrase may be ordinary collecting expenses and in appropriate cases could also include such expenses as attorneys fees.\u00a0 \"Finance charges\" are also referred to because in some cases interest or a finance charge is charged by the collecting bank for the time that the bank's advance on the item is outstanding prior to receipt of proceeds of collection.\u00a0 An example of this type of case would be where a bank undertakes a foreign collection in South America or Europe and makes an advance on the item at the time of receipt but may not receive proceeds of the foreign collection for three months or more.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-201, 3-414, 3-417, 3-418, 4-206, 4-208, 4-209 and 4-406.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Draft\".\u00a0 Section 3-104.\n\u00a0 \"Genuine\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Holder\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Holder in due course\".\u00a0 Section 3-302.\n\u00a0 \"Insolvency proceedings\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Person\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Presentment\".\u00a0 Section 3-504.\n\u00a0 \"Protest\".\u00a0 Section 3-509.\n\u00a0 \"Unauthorized signature\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
