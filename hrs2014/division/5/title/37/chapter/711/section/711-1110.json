[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nNote\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The amendment by L 2013, c 205, \u00a74 was placed at \u00a7711-1100.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7711-1109 TO 1110\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 When the Legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it declined to accept the Proposed Draft's treatment of the offense of cruelty to animals.\u00a0 Section 711-1109 as adopted clarifies the existing law relating to the offense of \"cruelty to animals.\"\u00a0 It makes it a crime to \"knowingly or recklessly\" overdrive, overload, torture, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, cruelly beat, or needlessly mutilate or kill any living creature.\u00a0 The section prohibits the keeping, using, management, or receipt of money for admission for fighting or baiting any \"bull, bear, dog, cock, or other creature.\"\u00a0 It also bars the carrying of any creature in a cruel or inhumane manner, and bars any other act towards the furtherance of any act of cruelty to animals.\n\u00a0 The section provides that if a domestic animal is so severely injured that there is no reasonable probability that its life or usefulness can be saved, the animal may be immediately destroyed.\n\u00a0 The section also states that the provisions do not apply to \"accepted veterinary practices\" and \"scientific research\" activities.\n\u00a0 Section 711-1110 is a new section which was not contained in the Proposed Draft.\u00a0 It authorizes agents of any society for the prevention of cruelty to animals to make arrests for violations of \u00a7711-1109.\n\u00a0 The Code basically retains the prior existing Hawaii law relating to this subject.\u00a0 Thus the provisions set forth in HRS Chapter 722, with updating, appear to be restated in substantial part in the Code.\u00a0 The Code treatment thus differs from the brief provision recommended by the Proposed Draft.\u00a0 The Legislature felt that the provision was too vague to prevent some types of mistreatment of animals.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972)."
