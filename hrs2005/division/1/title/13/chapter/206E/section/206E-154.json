Upon such filing, the revenues, moneys, or property so pledged thereafter received by the authority shall immediately be subject to the lien of any such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of such pledge shall be prior to the lien of all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.  This section shall apply to any financing statement heretofore or hereafter filed with the bureau of conveyances with respect to any pledge made to secure revenue bonds issued under this part.
