[L 2013, c 284, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Hawaii Arbitration Act did not apply to plaintiff's counsel's communications.\u00a0 Subsection (a) barred the application of the Act because it was undisputed that the mediation at issue was based on an agreement to mediate in a July 2009 settlement.\u00a0 Under subsection (b), the Act could apply to a mediation between the parties, based on a July 2009 agreement, occurring after January 1, 2014, but the mediation at issue occurred nearly four years earlier.\u00a0 40 F. Supp. 3d 1312 (2014)."
