For any such withholding required by the board, the producer-distributor or distributor shall be paid a reasonable fee by the board.  The amount of the fee shall be set by the board.  An agricultural cooperative all of whose producer-members have complied with the licensing provisions of this chapter shall be exempt from the payment of the license fee.
