[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-407; HRS \u00a7490:4-407; am L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Section 4-403 states that a stop payment order is binding on a bank.\u00a0 If a bank pays an item over such a stop order it is prima facie liable, but under subsection (3) of 4-403 the burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss from such payment is on the customer.\u00a0 A defense frequently interposed by a bank in an action against it for wrongful payment over a stop-order is that the drawer or maker suffered no loss because he would have been liable to a holder in due course in any event.\u00a0 On this argument some cases have held that payment cannot be stopped against a holder in due course.\u00a0 Payment can be stopped, but if it is, the drawer or maker is liable and the sound rule is that the bank is subrogated to the rights of the holder in due course.\u00a0 The preamble and subsection (a) of this section state this rule.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (b) also subrogates the bank to the rights of the payee or other holder against the drawer or maker either on the item or under the transaction out of which it arose.\u00a0 It may well be that the payee is not a holder in due course but still has good rights against the drawer.\u00a0 These may be on the check but also may not be as, for example, where the drawer buys goods from the payee and the goods are partially defective so that the payee is not entitled to the full price, but the goods are still worth a portion of the contract price.\u00a0 If the drawer retains the goods he is obligated to pay a part of the agreed price.\u00a0 If the bank has paid the check it should be subrogated to this claim of the payee against the drawer.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (c) subrogates the bank to the rights of the drawer or maker against the payee or other holder with respect to the transaction out of which the item arose.\u00a0 If, for example, the payee was a fraudulent salesman inducing the drawer to issue his check for defective securities, and the bank pays the check over a stop order but reimburses the drawer for such payment, the bank should have a basis for getting the money back from the fraudulent salesman.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The limitations of the preamble prevent the bank itself from getting any double recovery or benefits out of its subrogation rights conferred by the section.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The spelling out of the affirmative rights of the bank in this section does not destroy other existing rights (Section 1-103).\u00a0 Among others these may include the defense of a payor bank that by conduct in recognizing the payment a customer has ratified the bank's action in paying in disregard of a stop payment order or rights to recover money paid under a mistake.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Section 4-403.\n\u00a0\u00a0Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Holder\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Holder in due course\".\u00a0 Section 3-302.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105."
