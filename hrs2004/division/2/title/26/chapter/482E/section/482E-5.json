Every person who sells a franchise in this State shall file with the director in such form as the director by rule prescribes, an irrevocable consent appointing the commissioner or the commissioner's successor in office to be the person's attorney, to receive service or any lawful process in any noncriminal suit, action, or proceeding against the person or the person's successor, executor, administrator, or personal representative which arises under this chapter or any rule or order hereunder after the consent has been filed, with the same force and validity as if served personally on the person filing consent.  A person who has filed such a consent in connection with a previous sale under this law need not file another.  Service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the commissioner but is not effective unless: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe plaintiff, who may be the director, in a suit, action, or proceeding instituted by the plaintiff forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by registered or certified mail to the defendant or respondent at the defendant's or respondent's last address on file with the director; and\n\t(2)\tThe plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this section is filed in the case on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within such further times the court allows.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  In any proceeding under this chapter, the burden of proving an exception or an exemption from a definition is upon the person claiming it.
