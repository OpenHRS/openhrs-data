Supp. 920.\n  One element of conspiracy to monopolize is specific intent to control prices or destroy competition in any line of trade or commerce.  Test for specific intent is the same, whether applied to conspiracy or attempt to monopolize.  491 F. Supp. 1199. \n  Mere formality of separate incorporation is not, without more, sufficient to provide the capability for conspiracy.  Parent corporation controlled subsidiary to such a degree that the two entities in substance constitute a single entity incapable of conspiring with itself.  513 F.
