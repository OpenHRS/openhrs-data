When the commissioner issues or extends a certificate of authority, the commissioner shall determine the date prior to which the certificate of authority must be extended and shall so notify the insurer in writing.  This date is called the extension date.  The extension date shall be any date not less than one year and not more than three years after date of issue or extension of the certificate of authority.  If the insurer qualifies, its certificate of authority shall be extended.\n\t(b)  The commissioner shall amend a certificate of authority at any time in accordance with changes in the insurer's charter or insuring powers.
