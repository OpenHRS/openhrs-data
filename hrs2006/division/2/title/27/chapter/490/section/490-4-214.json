[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-212; HRS \u00a7490:4-212; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None; but see Sections 2 and 11, American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Under current bank practice, in a major portion of cases banks make provisional settlement for items when they are first received and then await subsequent determination of whether the item will be finally paid.\u00a0 This is the principal characteristic of what are referred to in banking parlance as \"cash items\".\u00a0 Statistically, this practice of settling provisionally first and then awaiting final payment is justified because more than ninety-nine per cent of such cash items are finally paid, with the result that in this great preponderance of cases it becomes unnecessary for the banks making the provisional settlements to make any further entries.\u00a0 In due course the provisional settlements become final simply with the lapse of time.\u00a0 However, in those cases where the item being collected is not finally paid or where for various reasons the bank making the provisional settlement does not itself receive final payment, under the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, under Federal Reserve Regulations and operating letters and under various types of agreements between banks and between customers and banks, provision is made for the reversal of the provisional settlements, charge-back of provisional credits and the right to obtain refund.\u00a0 Subsection (1) codifies and simplifies the statement of these rights.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Various causes of a bank not receiving final payment, with the resulting right of charge-back or refund, are stated or suggested in subsection (1).\u00a0 These include dishonor of the original item; dishonor of a remittance instrument given for it; reversal of a provisional credit for the item; suspension of payments by another bank.\u00a0 The causes stated are illustrative; the right of charge-back or refund is stated to exist whether the failure to receive final payment in ordinary course arises through one of them \"or otherwise\".\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The right of charge-back or refund exists if a collecting bank has made a provisional settlement for an item with its customer but terminates if and when a settlement received by the bank for the item is or becomes final.\u00a0 If the bank fails to receive such a final settlement the right of charge-back or refund must be exercised promptly after the bank learns the facts.\u00a0 The right exists (if so promptly exercised) whether or not the bank is able to return the item.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsection (2) is an affirmative provision for so-called \"direct returns\".\u00a0 This is a new practice that is currently in the process of developing in a few sections of the country.\u00a0 Its purpose is to speed up the return of unpaid items by avoiding handling by one or more intermediate banks.\u00a0 The subsection is bracketed because the practice is not yet well established and some bankers and bank lawyers would prefer to let the practice develop by agreement.\u00a0 The contention is made that substantive rights between banks may be affected, e.g. available set-offs, but proponents contend advantages of direct returns outweigh possible detriments.\u00a0 However, if the subsection were omitted, the election to use direct returns would be on the depositary bank and it would probably be necessary for that bank to specifically authorize direct returns with each outgoing letter.\u00a0 This is a cumbersome way of meeting the problem.\u00a0 If the subsection is retained the payor bank, unless it has been specifically directed otherwise, will have the right to make the decision whether it will return an unpaid item directly.\u00a0 Since the subsection is permissive and its inclusion tends toward greater flexibility, its retention is recommended.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The rule of subsection (4) relating to charge-back (as distinguished from claim for refund) applies irrespective of the cause of the nonpayment, and of the person ultimately liable for nonpayment.\u00a0 Thus charge-back is permitted even where nonpayment results from the depositary bank's own negligence.\u00a0 Any other rule would result in litigation based upon a claim for wrongful dishonor of other checks of the customer, with potential damages far in excess of the amount of the item.\u00a0 Any other rule would require a bank to determine difficult questions of fact.\u00a0 The customer's protection is found in the general obligation of good faith (Sections 1-203 and 4-103).\u00a0 If bad faith is established the customer's recovery \"includes other damages, if any, suffered by the party as a proximate consequence\" (Section 4-103(5); see also Section 4-402).\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 It is clear that the charge-back does not relieve the bank from any liability for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling the item.\u00a0 The measure of damages for such failure is stated in Section 4-103(5).\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Subsection (6) states a rule fixing the time for determining the rate of exchange if there is a charge-back or refund of a credit given in dollars for an item payable in a foreign currency.\u00a0 Compare Section 3-107(2).\u00a0 Fixing such a rule is desirable to avoid disputes.\u00a0 If in any case the parties wish to fix a different time for determining the rate of exchange, they may do so by agreement.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 1-203, 3-107, 4-103, 4-211(3), 4-213(2) and (3), 4-402.\n\u00a0\u00a0Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Account\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Depositary bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Intermediary bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Midnight deadline\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Send\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Settlement\". \u00a0Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Suspension of payment\".\u00a0 Section 4-104."
