[L 1963, c 158, pt of \u00a73; Supp, \u00a795-1; HRS ; am L 1972, c 122, \u00a71; am L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Numeric designations deleted and definitions rearranged.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Because defendant concedes that it is contractually responsible for managing the resorts that plaintiff employees have worked at and had the authority to do so, there was no genuine issue of fact that defendant \"permit[ted] or suffer[ed]\" plaintiffs to work, and was therefore their \"employer\" under this section.\u00a0 810 F. Supp. 2d 1145 (2011).\n\u00a0 In reading \u00a7388-3 in the context of the entire statute and in light of the common law, the trial court did not err in concluding that payment for unused vacation upon separation from employment did not constitute \"wages\" under the plain meaning of this section.\u00a0 108 H. 411, 121 P.3d 391 (2005)."
