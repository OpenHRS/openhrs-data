After notice and hearing, the commissioner may also order the insurer to void any of the contracts and restore the status quo if that action is in the best interest of the policyholders, creditors, or the public.\n\t(d)  Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any insurer or any director, officer, employee, or agent thereof has committed a wilful violation of this article, the commissioner may cause criminal proceedings to be instituted against the insurer or the responsible director, officer, employee, or agent thereof.  Any insurer who wilfully violates this article shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $10,000 per violation.  Any individual who wilfully violates this article shall be subject to a fine in the individual's capacity of not less than $100 and not more than $10,000 per violation, or be imprisoned for not more than one year.\n\t(e)  Any officer, director, or employee of an insurance holding company system who wilfully and knowingly subscribes to or makes, or causes to be made, any false statements, false reports, or false filings with the intent to deceive the commissioner in the performance of the commissioner's duties under this article, upon conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than one year, or fined $5,000, or both.  Any fines imposed shall be paid by the officer, director, or employee in the person's individual capacity.
