The projections for both new and renewal business may include separate projections for each major line of business and separately identify each significant income, expense, and benefit component;\n\t(4)\tIdentify the key assumptions having an impact on the insurer's projections and the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions; and\n\t(5)\tIdentify the quality of, and problems associated with, the insurer's business, including but not limited to its assets, anticipated business growth and associated surplus strain, extraordinary exposure to risk, mix of business, and use of reinsurance in each case, if any.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The risk-based capital plan shall be submitted:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWithin forty-five days of the company action level event; or\n\t(2)\tIf the insurer challenges an adjusted risk-based capital report pursuant to section 431:3-407, within forty-five days after notification to the insurer that the commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer's challenge.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  Within sixty days after the submission by an insurer of a risk-based capital plan to the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the insurer whether the risk-based capital plan shall be implemented or is, in the judgment of the commissioner, unsatisfactory.  If the commissioner determines the risk-based capital plan is unsatisfactory, the notification to the insurer shall set forth the reasons for the determination, and may set forth proposed revisions which will render the risk-based capital plan satisfactory, in the judgment of the commissioner.  Upon notification from the commissioner, the insurer shall prepare a revised risk-based capital plan, which may incorporate by reference any revisions proposed by the commissioner, and shall submit the revised risk-based capital plan to the commissioner:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWithin forty-five days after the notification from the commissioner; or\n\t(2)\tIf the insurer challenges the notification from the commissioner under section 431:3-407, within forty-five days after a notification to the insurer that the commissioner has, after a hearing, rejected the insurer's challenge.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  In the event of a notification by the commissioner to an insurer that the insurer's risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan is unsatisfactory, the commissioner, at the commissioner's discretion, subject to the insurer's right to a hearing under section 431:3-407, may specify in the notification that the notification constitutes a regulatory action level event.\n\t(f)  Every domestic insurer that files a risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan with the commissioner shall file a copy of the risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan with the insurance commissioner in any state in which the insurer is authorized to do business if:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThat state has a risk-based capital provision substantially similar to section 431:3-408(a); and\n\t(2)\tThe insurance commissioner of that state has notified the insurer of its request for the filing in writing, in which case the insurer shall file a copy of the risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan in that state no later than the later of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tFifteen days after the receipt of notice to file a copy of its risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan with that state; or\n\t\t(B)\tThe date on which the risk-based capital plan or revised risk-based capital plan is filed under subsections (c) and (d).
