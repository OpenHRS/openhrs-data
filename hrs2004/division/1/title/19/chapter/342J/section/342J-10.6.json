    "text": "(a)  In a case where the owner or operator is in bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangement pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Code or where (with reasonable diligence) jurisdiction in any state court cannot be obtained over an owner or operator likely to be solvent at the time of judgment, any claim arising from conduct for which evidence of financial responsibility must be provided under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter may be asserted directly against the guarantor providing evidence of financial responsibility.  In the case of any action pursuant to this section, the guarantor shall be entitled to invoke all rights and defenses which would have been available to the owner or operator by the claimant and which would have been available to the guarantor if an action had been brought against the guarantor by the owner or operator.\n\t(b)  The total liability of any guarantor shall be limited to the aggregate amount which the guarantor has provided as evidence of financial responsibility to the owner or operator under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any other statutory, contractual or common law liability of a guarantor to its owner or operator including, but not limited to, the liability of the guarantor for bad faith either in negotiations or in failing to negotiate the settlement of any claim.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the liability of any person under chapter 128D or other applicable law.\n\t(c)  For the purpose of this section, the term \"guarantor\" means any person, other than the owner or operator, who provides evidence of financial responsibility for an owner or operator under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.
