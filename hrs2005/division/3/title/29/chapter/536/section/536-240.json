    "name": "General rules:  True intent, as gathered from all parts of will, is of first importance.  3 H. 421, 443; 6 H. 8, 10; 6 H. 228; 8 H. 392, 401; 10 H. 543, 545; 11 H. 47, 51; 12 H. 104, 108, 117; 12 H. 375, 379; 13 H. 319; 18 H. 52, 70, aff'd 211 U.S. 321, 330; 21 H. 619, 622; 22 H. 233, ; 22 H. 510, 513; 22 H. 644, 647; 25 H. 22, 30; 28 H. 590, reversed on other grounds 26 F.2d 609; 29 H. 474; 29 H. 854; 30 H. 246; 30 H. 217; 31 H. 92; 31 H. 535; 59 F.2d 681; 61 F.2d 598.  Extrinsic evidence of intention as an independent fact is inadmissible to supply any material provision or omission by mistake.  24 H. 230, 237.  Facts and circumstances at date of death.  5 H. 146, 149; 26 H. 219, 229; 31 H. 259.  In case of irreconcilable clauses, the latter will generally prevail and, in case of inconsistent general and specific provisions, the specific will prevail, but this rule does not apply where a contrary intent has been manifested.  21 H. 499, 505; 22 H. 233, 240; 22 H. 510, 514.  A conflict between two provisions is not to be regarded as irreconcilable unless harmony is found impossible.  23 H. 317.  \"Die without a child\", or \"without leaving any issue\", are somewhat ambiguous and may mean \"without having had a child\", or \"without leaving any issue surviving\", according to testator's intent as gathered from context.  See 10 H. 547; 12 H. 375.  Omissions in a will cannot be supplied by parol proof of intentions; declarations of testator are admissible only if there is a latent ambiguity.  22 H. 644, 650.  Technical words will be subordinated to intent of testator.  23 H. 747, 752, aff'd 255 F. 732; 27 H. 462, 463.  Technical words will be so construed, unless context shows a clear intent to contrary.  23 H. 747, aff'd 255 F. 732.  Greater latitude is allowed in construing technical words in wills than in deeds.  24 H. 298, 306.",
