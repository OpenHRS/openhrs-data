If the person fails to complete the drug treatment program and if no other suitable treatment is amenable to the offender, the person shall be returned to court and subject to sentencing under the applicable section under this part.  As a condition of probation under this subsection, the court shall require an assessment as to the treatment needs of the defendant, conducted by a person certified by the department of health to conduct the assessments.  The drug treatment program for the defendant shall be based upon the assessment.  The court may require the person to contribute to the cost of the drug treatment program.\n\t(3)  For the purposes of this section, \"drug treatment program\" means drug or substance abuse services provided outside a correctional facility, but the services do not require the expenditure of state moneys beyond the limits of available appropriations.\n\t(4)  The court, upon written application from a person sentenced under this part, shall issue a court order to expunge the record of arrest for that particular conviction; provided that a person shall be eligible for one time only for expungement under this subsection.\n\t(5)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to give rise to a cause of action against the State, state employee, or treatment provider.
