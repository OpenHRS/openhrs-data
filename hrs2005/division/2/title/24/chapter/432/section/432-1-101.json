The provisions of this article shall apply to mutual benefit societies as defined herein.  Except as expressly provided in this article, mutual benefit societies shall be exempt from the provisions of the insurance code.  No law enacted after July 1, 1988, shall apply to mutual benefit societies unless such societies are expressly designated therein. [L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72]\nRevision Note\n  \"July 1, 1988,\" substituted for \"the effective date of this article\".\nAttorney General Opinions\n  Based on provision, the requirement of \u00a7431:10A-601 as set forth in \u00a74 of reciprocal beneficiaries act [L 1997, c 383] cannot be interpreted to apply to mutual benefit societies.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-5.\nCase Notes\n  Section 431:15-102 creates an exception to the general rule established by this section that mutual benefit societies are typically exempt from provision of the Insurance Code; thus, article 15 of chapter 431 applies to mutual benefit societies.  99 H. 53, 52 P.3d 823."
