    "text": "PART II.  SALE OF UNITED STATES SURPLUS GOODS\n\n     The legislature of the State of Hawaii finds that the sale and distribution at retail of goods manufactured by or for or sold by the government of the United States, or any agency or department thereof, is peculiarly susceptible to fraud and misrepresentation.  The public interest requires that goods offered for sale in connection with representations of any form in which the government of the United States or any agency or department thereof is involved should be accurately identified and correctly described.  The commingling of goods in such a way as might create a misapprehension on the part of any purchaser that the purchaser is buying goods sold by the government of the United States or any agency or department thereof, or that the goods were manufactured pursuant to government specifications, or that the goods in fact are at the time of sale in accordance with such specifications, or that the goods are new or in perfect condition, when not true in fact, is hereby declared inimical to public interest and an unfair trade practice. [L 1945, c 214, \u00a71; RL 1955, \u00a7205-40; HRS ; gen ch 1985]"
