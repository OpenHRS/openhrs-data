    "text": "\u00a7431:6-403    (a)  Any personal property or securities lawfully acquired by an insurer, which it could not otherwise have invested in or loaned its funds upon at the time of the acquisition, shall be disposed of by the insurer within three years from date of acquisition, unless within such period the security has attained the standard for eligibility.  The commissioner, upon application and reasonable showing that forced sale of any such property or security would be against the best interests of the insurer, may extend the disposal period for an additional reasonable time.\n\t(b)  While any such property or security remains so ineligible, it shall not be allowed as an asset of the insurer.\n\t(c)  Any ineligible property or security acquired contrary to this article by an insurer shall be disposed of forthwith; for failure so to do within sixty days after order of the commissioner requiring such disposal, the commissioner may revoke or suspend the insurer's certificate of authority.\n\t(d)  For the purposes of subsection (c), an investment otherwise eligible shall not be deemed ineligible for the reason that it is in excess of the amount permitted under this article to be invested in the category of investments to which it belongs; any such excess investment shall be disposed of within the time prescribed in subsection (a).
