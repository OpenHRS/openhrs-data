The pleading or affidavit must state whether the party:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tHas participated, as a party or witness or in any other capacity, in any other proceeding concerning the custody of or visitation with the child and, if so, identify the court, the case number, and the date of the child-custody determination, if any;\n\t(2)\tKnows of any proceeding that could affect the current proceeding, including proceedings for enforcement and proceedings relating to domestic violence, protective orders, termination of parental rights, and adoptions, and, if so, identify the court, the case number, and the nature of the proceeding; and\n\t(3)\tKnows the names and addresses of any person not a party to the proceeding who has physical custody of the child or claims rights of legal custody or physical custody of, or visitation with, the child and, if so, the names and addresses of those persons.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  If the information required by subsection (a) is not furnished, the court, upon motion of a party or its own motion, may stay the proceeding until the information is furnished.\n\t(c)  If the declaration as to any of the items described in subsection (a)(1) to (3) is in the affirmative, the declarant shall give additional information under oath as required by the court.  The court may examine the parties under oath as to details of the information furnished and other matters pertinent to the court's jurisdiction and the disposition of the case.\n\t(d)  Each party shall have a continuing duty to inform the court of any proceeding in this or any other state that could affect the current proceeding.\n\t(e)  Upon a finding, which may be ex parte, that the health, safety, or liberty of a party or child would be unreasonably put at risk by the disclosure of identifying information, or if an existing order so provides, the court shall order that the address of the child or party or other identifying information shall not be disclosed in a pleading or other documents filed in a proceeding under this section.
