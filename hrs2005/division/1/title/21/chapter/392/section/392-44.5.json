The department shall review the denial within ten days of the receipt of the notice.  If the department finds the denial erroneous, without proper legal basis, or without sufficient evidence to support it, the department shall request the employer or insurer to reconsider its action in denying disability benefits.  If upon reconsideration the employer or insurer again decides to deny disability benefits, the employee and the department shall be so notified.  The employee shall have the right to appeal the denial of disability benefits. [L 1972, c 120, \u00a71]"
