The petitioner shall bear the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence the need for and the amount of any adjustment.  The adjustments shall be determined as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe value of the baseline price shall be equal to the average of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe spot pipeline daily price for regular unleaded gasoline for Los Angeles;\n\t\t(B)\tThe spot pipeline daily price for regular unleaded gasoline for San Francisco; and\n\t\t(C)\tThe spot daily price for the Pacific Northwest,\n\n\t\tas reported and published by the Oil Price Information Service for the five business days of the preceding week;\n\t(2)\tThe value of the location adjustment factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted to equal the average of the actual acquisition cost to non-refiner marketers to obtain gasoline from refiners or importers for sale on the island of Oahu over the prior twelve-month period, which cost shall be taken from arm's length transactions between non-refiner marketers, and refiners or importers, such as exchange agreements, sales agreements, or other similar agreements; provided that the location adjustment factor shall not exceed the reasonable cost of importing gasoline to the island of Oahu. As used in this paragraph, \"actual acquisition cost\" means the amount over the base price of regular unleaded gasoline that a non-refiner marketer pays to a third party for delivery of such gasoline into a terminal located on the island of Oahu;\n\t(3)\tThe value of the marketing margin factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted by adding to such value the difference between:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe average of the difference over the prior twelve-month period between:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe dealer tank wagon price for sales for resale; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe bulk price for sales for resale, for Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) District V,\n\n\t\t\tas reported and published by the Energy Information Administration or its successor in Table 31 - \"Motor Gasoline Prices by Grade, Sales Type, PAD District, and State\" or other source containing the same information; less\n\t\t(B)\tThe average of the difference over the period from 1994 until the most current year between:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe dealer tank wagon price for sales for resale; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe bulk price for sales for resale, for Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) District V,\n\n\t\t\tas reported and published by the Energy Information Administration or its successor in Table 31 - \"Motor Gasoline Prices by Grade, Sales Type, PAD District, and State\" or other source containing the same information;\n\n\t(4)\tThe value of the neighbor island location adjustment factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted to equal the actual acquisition cost to non-refiner marketers to obtain gasoline from a refiner or importer for sale on the island of Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, or Hawaii, over the prior twelve-month period, which cost shall be taken from arm's length transactions between non-refiner marketers, and refiners or importers, such as exchange agreements, sales agreements, or other similar agreements; provided that the neighbor island location adjustment factor shall not exceed the reasonable cost of importing gasoline to the island of Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, or Hawaii, from any port on the island of Oahu.  As used in this subsection, \"actual acquisition cost\" means the amount over the base price of regular unleaded gasoline that a non-refiner marketer [pays] to a third party for delivery of such gasoline into a terminal located on Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, or Hawaii; and\n\t(5)\tThe value of the neighbor island marketing factor in effect at the time the petition is filed shall be adjusted if there are material changes in the cost factors associated with marketing gasoline on the island of Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Maui, or Hawaii, such as terminaling, storage, or distribution costs.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  A retail station may petition the commission to adjust the maximum pre-tax retail price of gasoline in the event of a change in the maximum pre-tax wholesale price for regular unleaded gasoline, or the value of the retail marketing margin factor.  The petitioner shall bear the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence the need for and the amount of any adjustment.  The adjustment shall be determined as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe value of the retail marketing margin factor for regular unleaded gasoline established in section 486H-14(c) shall be adjusted upward only if such value is less than the average of the difference over the prior twelve-month period between:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe \"through retail outlets\" price for sales to end users for regular unleaded gasoline; and\n\t\t(B)\tThe dealer tank wagon price, for sales for resale for regular unleaded gasoline, for Petroleum Administration for Defense (PAD) District V,\n\n\t\tas reported and published by the Energy Information Administration or its successor in Table 31 - \"Motor Gasoline Prices by Grade, Sales Type, PAD District, and State\" or other source containing the same information.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If the commission adjusts the maximum pre-tax wholesale price or the maximum pre-tax retail price of regular unleaded gasoline, the commission shall publish its findings and the adjusted prices by means that shall include the Internet website for the State of Hawaii.\n\t(d)  In its discretion and without a petition having been filed, the commission may adjust the maximum pre-tax wholesale price or the maximum pre-tax retail price of regular unleaded gasoline if an adjustment is necessary as a result of a change in the value of the baseline price for regular unleaded gasoline, the location adjustment factor, the marketing margin factor, the neighbor island wholesale adjustment factor, or the retail marketing margin factor.\n\t(e)  Nothing in section 486H-13 or 486H-14 shall be construed to prohibit the filing of a petition during the first year after July 1, 2004.
