    "text": "\u00a7560:5-304    The family court may appoint any competent person, whose appointment would be in the best interest of the alleged incapacitated person, as a guardian of the person as requested if it is satisfied that the person for whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated and that the appointment is necessary or desirable as a means of providing continuing care and supervision of the person of the incapacitated person, except that unless otherwise specified in the court order, guardians shall not have the power to consent to the sterilization of their wards.  The order of appointment may limit or otherwise modify the power of the guardian of the person or may specify areas in which the ward shall retain the power to make and carry out decisions concerning the ward's person.  Alternatively, the family court may dismiss the proceeding or enter any other appropriate order.
