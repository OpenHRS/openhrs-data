Upon such sale, the property ceases to be the subject of a condominium property regime or subject to this chapter.\n\t(b)  All of the apartment owners may remove a property, or a part of a property, from this chapter by an instrument to that effect, duly recorded, provided that the holders of all liens affecting any of the apartments consent thereto, by instruments duly recorded.  Upon such removal from this chapter, the property, or the part of the property designated in the instrument, ceases to be the subject of a condominium property regime or subject to this chapter, and is deemed to be owned in common by the apartment owners in proportion to their respective common interests.\n\t(c)  Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), if the apartment leases for a leasehold project (including condominium conveyance documents, ground leases, or similar instruments creating a leasehold interest in the land) provide that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe estate and interest of the apartment owner shall cease and determine upon the acquisition, by an authority with power of eminent domain of title and right to possession of any part of the project;\n\t(2)\tThe apartment owner shall not by reason of the acquisition or right to possession be entitled to any claim against the lessor or others for compensation or indemnity for the apartment owner's leasehold interest;\n\t(3)\tAll compensation and damages for or on account of any land shall be payable to and become the sole property of the lessor;\n\t(4)\tAll compensation and damages for or on account of any buildings or improvements on the demised land shall be payable to and become the sole property of the apartment owners of the buildings and improvements in accordance with their interests; and \n\t(5)\tThe apartment lease rents are reduced in proportion to the land so acquired or possessed;\n\n\n\nthen, the lessor and the declarant shall file an amendment to the declaration to reflect any acquisition or right to possession.  The consent or joinder of the apartment owners or their respective mortgagees shall not be required, if the land so acquired or possessed constitutes no more than five per cent of the total land of the project.  Upon the filing of the amendment, the land acquired or possessed shall cease to be the subject of a condominium property regime or this chapter.  The lessor shall notify each apartment owner in writing of the filing of the amendment and the rent abatement to which the apartment owner is entitled.
