The account shall contain such segregation of principal and income as the principal in writing specifically requires.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  Unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation, any claim against an agent for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the agency relationship is barred as to any principal to whom the agent has mailed or delivered an annual or final accounting fully disclosing the matter in question unless a proceeding to assert the claim is commenced within two years after the annual or final accounting has been mailed or delivered to the principal.  In any event and notwithstanding lack of full disclosure, an agent who has mailed or delivered an annual or final accounting to the principal and has informed the principal of the location and availability of records for the principal's examination is protected after three years from the date such accounting was mailed or delivered.\n\t(d)  Every trust company shall have on hand at all times in actual money of the United States an amount equal to at least twelve per cent of all agency credit balances payable on demand and of accounts payable, plus at least five per cent of all agency credit balances payable on time; provided that such reserve may be deposited payable on demand in banks and other trust companies approved by the commissioner or may be cash in the vaults of the trust company.\n\t(e)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to occasional or isolated acts performed under special instructions or at the special request of a principal who is not a general or regular client of the trust company.
