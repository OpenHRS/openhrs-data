    "number": "7",
    "text": "(a)  A custodial trustee shall register or record the instrument transferring title to custodial trust property if appropriate.\n\t(b)  In the management, control, investment, or retention of custodial trust property, a custodial trustee shall follow the directions of the beneficiary if the beneficiary is not incapacitated.  In the absence of effective contrary direction by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other law restricting investments by fiduciaries.  However, a custodial trustee, in the custodial trustee's discretion, may retain any custodial trust property received from the transferor.  If a trust company or other custodial trustee has a special skill or expertise or is named custodial trustee on the basis of representation of a special skill or expertise, the custodial trustee shall use that skill or expertise.\n\t(c)  Subject to subsection (b), a custodial trustee shall take control of and collect, hold, manage, invest, and reinvest custodial trust property.\n\t(d)  A custodial trustee at all times shall keep custodial trust property of which the custodial trustee has possession and control, separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial trust property of the beneficiary.  Custodial trust property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded, and custodial trust property subject to registration is so identified if it is registered, or held in an account designated, in the name of the custodial trustee followed by words stating in substance:  \"as custodial trustee for _________________________ (name of beneficiary) under the Hawaii Uniform Custodial Trust Act.\"\n\t(e)  A custodial trustee shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial trust property, including information necessary for the preparation of tax returns, and shall make the records and information available at reasonable intervals to the beneficiary or legal representative of the beneficiary.\n\t(f)  The exercise of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated beneficiary is not effective to terminate or direct the distribution or management of the custodial trust.
