The general penalty provision of this section shall not apply to:\n\n\t\t(A)\tAny operator of a motor vehicle owned by another person if the operator's own insurance covers such driving;\n\t\t(B)\tAny operator of a motor vehicle owned by that person's employer during the normal scope of that person's employment; or\n\t\t(C)\tAny operator of a borrowed motor vehicle if the operator holds a reasonable belief that the subject vehicle is insured; and\n\n\t(5)\tIn the case of multiple convictions for driving without a valid motor vehicle insurance policy within a five-year period from any prior offense, the court, in addition to any other penalty, shall impose the following penalties:\n\n\t\t(A)\tImprisonment of not more than thirty days;\n\t\t(B)\tSuspension or revocation of the motor vehicle registration plates of the vehicle involved;\n\t\t(C)\tImpoundment, or impoundment and sale, of the motor vehicle for the costs of storage and other charges incident to seizure of the vehicle, or any other cost involved pursuant to section 431:10C-301; or\n\t\t(D)\tAny combination of those penalties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(b)  Any person, in the capacity of a licensed or unlicensed motor vehicle insurer, self-insurer, producer, or other representative, who violates any provision of this article shall be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each violation.\n\t(c)  Any person, in the capacity of a licensed or unlicensed motor vehicle insurer, self-insurer, producer, or other representative, who knowingly violates any provision of this article shall be assessed a civil penalty of not less than $3,000 and not to exceed $10,000 for each violation.\n\n\n\n\t(d)\t(1)  Violations of subsections (b) and (c) shall be subject to the construction that each repetition of such act shall constitute a separate violation; and\n\t(2)\tThe imposition of any civil penalty under subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall be in addition to, and shall not in any way limit or affect the application of, any other civil or criminal penalty, or public safety condition or requirement, provided by law. [L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72; am L 1988, c 345, \u00a71; am L 1989, c 348, \u00a71; am L 1990, c 167, \u00a71; am L 1993, c 205, \u00a725; am L Sp 1993, c 4, \u00a74; am L 1996, c 20, \u00a71; ree L 1997, c 2, \u00a711 and am c 251, \u00a727; am L 1998, c 231, \u00a72 and c 275, \u00a79; am L 2002, c 155, \u00a769]\n\n\n\n\nCase Notes\n  Applies to repeat offenders and to defendants being sentenced at a single proceeding.  751 F. Supp. 1420.\n  Borrower of a vehicle cannot assert a good-faith defense without at least inquiring of the owner whether or not the vehicle is insured.  71 H. 178, 787 P.2d 214.\n  Where State conceded that appellant had borrowed uninsured vehicle from a friend, in order to defeat lack of knowledge defense, State was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant actually knew that the vehicle was uninsured at the time appellant was operating it.  78 H. 86, 890 P.2d 673.\n  As \u00a7571-1 mandates against treating juvenile adjudications as convictions, appellate court erred in holding that defendant's prior juvenile adjudication of driving without no-fault insurance constituted a conviction for purposes of applying the repeat offender sentencing provisions of this section (1993) to defendant's subsequent offense of driving without no-fault insurance.  92 H. 521, 993 P.2d 555.\n  Section mandates that an insurer be fined if it violates \u00a7431:10C-207 but gives the commissioner some discretion as to the amount of the fine; commissioner's imposition of $3,000 fine was not an abuse of discretion as it satisfied the statutory requirements.  104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196.\n  Certified copy of a person's traffic abstract is satisfactory evidence to establish the person's prior no no-fault insurance conviction; State not required to show defendant was counseled at time of prior no no-fault insurance conviction; there was insufficient proof of defendant's prior conviction to support enhanced sentence for no no-fault insurance offense, where record disclosed no evidence to tie defendant with [person with the same name] of the traffic abstract.  9 H. App. 516, 852 P.2d 476.\n  Pursuant to \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2) (1992) good faith defense and \u00a7431:10C-117(a)(2)(C) (1992) reasonable belief defense, borrower of a motor vehicle has a statutory right to reasonably believe that borrowed motor vehicle is insured.  If one or more relevant facts reasonably required borrower to inquire, borrower then had a duty to inquire until borrower reasonably believed that motor vehicle was insured.  10 H. App. 519, 879 P.2d 566.\n  It was the \"obvious intention\" of the legislature to authorize the retroactive application of the part of Act 167, L 1990, that authorized the sentencing court the discretion to impose a sentence of community service instead of a fine.  77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376.\n  Where defendant was sentenced pursuant to subsection (a)(2), because the district court may have been unaware of the applicability of quoted parts of \u00a7\u00a7706-641 and 706-642 and of its discretionary authority to sentence defendant to perform community service rather than to pay the fine, appellate court vacated the part of the sentence ordering defendant to pay a $1,000 fine and remanded that part for resentencing.  77 H. 476 (App.), 888 P.2d 376.\n  An officer who has grounds to arrest individual for driving without no-fault insurance is required to issue summons or citation in lieu of physically taking defendant to police station or court.  78 H. 98 (App.), 890 P.2d 685.\n  When trial court revoked driver's suspended sentence, it lacked authority to do so where the State, despite knowledge that driver had been arrested for another no-motor-vehicle-insurance charge, did not move to revoke driver's suspended sentence within the suspended sentence period, and driver was not convicted of the second citation charge until after the suspended sentence period for the first citation had already expired.  106 H. 391 (App.), 105 P.3d 1197."
