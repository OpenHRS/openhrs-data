A covered source shall not be assessed for emissions of a regulated air pollutant in excess of four thousand tons per year.\n\t(d)  Unless changed by rules, fees for covered sources shall be changed in December of each year only by the percentage, if any, by which the consumer price index for that calendar year exceeds the consumer price index for the prior calendar year.  The consumer price index for any calendar year is the average of the consumer price index for all urban consumers published by the United States Department of Labor, as of the close of the twelve-month period ending on August\u00a031 of each calendar year.\n\t(e)  Nothing in the cost-per-ton fee provisions of subsections (c) and (d) shall restrict the director from assessing more or less than the amount determined under subsections (c) and (d) from any one covered source or any class or category of covered sources, as designated by the director; provided the department collects a total amount of fees sufficient to cover the costs of the permit program.
