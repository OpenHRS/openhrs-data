It further is the intent of the legislature that all other emergency functions be coordinated to the maximum extent with the comparable functions of the federal government, its departments and agencies.\n\t(c)  It is declared to be the intent of the legislature to provide for and confer comprehensive powers for the purposes stated.  This chapter shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes, provided that this chapter shall not be construed as conferring any power or permitting any action which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, but, in so construing this chapter, due consideration shall be given to the circumstances as they exist from time to time.
