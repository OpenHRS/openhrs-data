Any plan for a subdivision shall, before approval of the court, be subject to approval by the planning department of any county having laws and regulations covering subdivisions, applicable thereto.  If action by the planning department on the proposed subdivision is unreasonably delayed, the court may order the planning department to appear and show cause why the subdivision should not be approved by the court.
