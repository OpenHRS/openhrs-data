    "text": "For the purpose of this title, there can be only one residence for an individual, but in determining residency, a person may treat oneself separate from the person's spouse.  The following rules shall determine residency for election purposes only:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe residence of a person is that place in which the person's habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever the person is absent, the person has the intention to return;\n\t(2)\tA person does not gain residence in any precinct into which the person comes without the present intention of establishing the person's permanent dwelling place within such precinct;\n\t(3)\tIf a person resides with the person's family in one place, and does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence; but any person having a family, who establishes the person's dwelling place other than with the person's family, with the intention of remaining there shall be considered a resident where the person has established such dwelling place;\n\t(4)\tThe mere intention to acquire a new residence without physical presence at such place, does not establish residency, neither does mere physical presence without the concurrent present intention to establish such place as the person's residence;\n\t(5)\tA person does not gain or lose a residence solely by reason of the person's presence or absence while employed in the service of the United States or of this State, or while a student of an institution of learning, or while kept in an institution or asylum, or while confined in a prison;\n\t(6)\tNo member of the armed forces of the United States, the member's spouse or the member's dependent is a resident of this State solely by reason of being stationed in the State;\n\t(7)\tA person loses the person's residence in this State if the person votes in an election held in another state by absentee ballot or in person.\n\n\n\nIn case of question, final determination of residence shall be made by the clerk, subject to appeal to the board of registration under part III of this chapter.
