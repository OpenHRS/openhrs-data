    "text": "\u00a7431:10A-105    Except as provided in section 431:10A-107, each policy of accident and health or sickness insurance delivered or issued for delivery to any person in this State shall contain the provisions set forth below.  These provisions shall be in the words in which they appear below; provided that the insurer may substitute corresponding provisions of different wording approved by the commissioner that are in each instance not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.  The provisions shall be preceded individually by the specified caption, or by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the commissioner may approve.  The provisions are as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\t\"Entire Contract; Changes:  This policy, including the endorsements and the attached papers, if any, constitutes the entire contract of insurance.  No change in this policy shall be valid until approved by an executive officer of the insurer and unless the approval is endorsed on or attached to this policy.  No agent has authority to change this policy or to waive any of its provisions.\"\n\t(2)\t(A)\t\"Time Limit on Certain Defenses:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tAfter three years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for this policy shall be used to void this policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of the three-year period.\n\t\t\t(ii)\tNo claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after three years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.\"\n\n\t\t(B)\tThe policy provision set forth in subparagraph (A)(i) shall not be construed to affect any legal requirement for avoidance of a policy or denial of a claim during the initial three-year period, nor to limit the application of section 431:10A-106(1) through (4) in the event of misstatement with respect to age or occupation or other insurance.\n\t\t(C)\tA policy that the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premium until at least age fifty or, in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue, may contain in lieu of subparagraph (A)(i) the following provision (from which the clause in parentheses may be omitted at the insurer's option):  \"Incontestable:  After this policy has been in force for a period of three years during the lifetime of the insured (excluding any period during which the insured is disabled), it shall become incontestable as to the statements contained in the application.\"\n\t(3)\t(A)\t\"Grace period:  A grace period of (insert a number not less than seven for weekly premium policies, ten for monthly premium policies, and thirty-one for all other policies) days will be granted for the payment of each premium falling due after the first premium, during which grace period the policy shall continue in force.\"\n\t\t(B)\tA policy that contains a cancellation provision may add at the end of the above provision:  \"subject to the right of the insurer to cancel in accordance with the cancellation provision.\"\n\t\t(C)\tA policy in which the insurer reserves the right to refuse any renewal shall have at the beginning of the above provision:  \"Unless not less than thirty days prior to the premium due date the insurer has delivered to the insured or has mailed to the insured's last address as shown by the records of the insurer written notice of its intention not to renew this policy beyond the period for which the premium has been accepted.\"\n\t(4)\t(A)\t\"Reinstatement:  If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the insured for payment, a subsequent acceptance of premium by the insurer or by any agent duly authorized by the insurer to accept the premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the policy; provided that if the insurer or agent requires an application for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the policy shall be reinstated upon approval of the application by the insurer or, lacking approval, upon the forty-fifth day following the date of conditional receipt unless the insurer has previously notified the insured in writing of its disapproval of the application.  The reinstated policy shall cover only loss resulting from accidental injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss due to sickness as may begin more than ten days after that date.  In all other respects the insured and insurer shall have the same rights as they had under the policy immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed hereon or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement.  Any premium accepted in connection with the reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty days prior to the date of reinstatement.\"\n\t\t(B)\tThe last sentence in subparagraph (A) may be omitted from any policy that the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age fifty or, in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four, for at least five years from its date of issue.\n\t(5)\t(A)\t\"Notice of Claim:  Written notice of claim must be given to the insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible.  Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the beneficiary to the insurer at (insert the location of the office as the insurer may designate for the purpose) or to any authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.\"\n\t\t(B)\tIn a policy providing a loss of time benefit that may be payable for at least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following between the first and second sentences in subparagraph (A):  \"Subject to the qualification set forth below, if the insured suffers loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be payable for at least two years, the insured shall, at least once in every six months after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continuance of the disability, except in the event of legal incapacity.  The period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or any payment by the insurer on account of the claim or any denial of liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in applying this provision.  Delay in giving notice shall not impair the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which notice is actually given.\"\n\n\t(6)\t\"Claim Forms:  The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim, will furnish to the claimant the forms, that are usually furnished by it for filing proofs of loss.  If the forms are not furnished within fifteen days after the giving of notice the claimant shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character, and the extent of the loss for which claim is made.\"\n\t(7)\t\"Proofs of Loss:  In case of claim for loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss, written proof of loss must be furnished to the insurer at its office within ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer is liable, and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days after the date of loss.  Failure to furnish proof of loss within the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within the time required, provided proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than fifteen months from the time proof is otherwise required.\"\n\t(8)\t\"Time of Payment of Claims:  Indemnities payable under this policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof of loss.  Subject to due written proof of loss, all accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic payment will be paid (insert period for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.\"\n\n\t(9)\t(A)\t\"Payment of Claims:  Indemnity for loss of life will be payable in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions respecting payment which may be prescribed herein and effective at the time of payment.  If no designation or provision is then effective, the indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.  Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may, at the option of the insurer, be paid either to the designated beneficiary or to the estate of the insured.  All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.\"\n\t\t(B)\tThe following provisions, or either of them, may be included with the provision set forth in subparagraph (A) at the option of the insurer:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\t\"If any indemnity of this policy shall be payable to the estate of the insured, or to an insured or beneficiary who is a minor or otherwise not competent to give a valid release, the insurer may pay the indemnity, up to an amount not exceeding $2,000 to any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto.  Any payment made by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully discharge the insurer to the extent of the payment.\"\n\t\t\t(ii)\t\"Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of loss, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering the services; but it is not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or person.\"\n\n\n\n\t(10)\t\"Physical Examinations and Autopsy:  The insurer at its own expense shall have the right and opportunity to examine the person of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of death where it is not forbidden by law.\"\n\t(11)\t\"Legal Actions:  No action at law or in equity shall be brought to recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements of this policy.  No action at law or in equity shall be brought after the expiration of three years after the time written proof of loss is required to be furnished.\"\n\n\t(12)\t(A)\t\"Change of Beneficiary:  Unless the insured makes an irrevocable designation of beneficiary, the right to change of beneficiary is reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or beneficiaries shall not be requisite to surrender or assignment of this policy or to any change of beneficiary or beneficiaries, or to any other changes in this policy.\"\n\t\t(B)\tThe first clause of subparagraph (A), relating to the irrevocable designation of beneficiary, may be omitted at the insurer's option.
