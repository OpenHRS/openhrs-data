Nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee-beneficiary from participating in a cafeteria plan authorized under Title 26 United States Code section 125, Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and part II of chapter 78.\n\t(b)  During the period the health benefits plan selected by an employee-beneficiary is in effect, the employee-beneficiary, if allowed by law, shall authorize the employee-beneficiary's contribution to be withheld and transmitted to the fund monthly by the comptroller, employees' retirement system, or finance officer who disburses the employee-beneficiary's compensation, pension, or retirement pay.  If an employee-beneficiary's contribution to the fund is not withheld and transmitted to the fund, the employee-beneficiary shall pay the monthly contribution:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIn the case of an employee-beneficiary who normally receives the employee-beneficiary's compensation from the comptroller or employees' retirement system, directly to the fund by the first day of each month; or\n\t(2)\tIn the case of all other employee-beneficiaries, to the respective finance officer from whom the employee-beneficiary normally receives compensation for transmittal to the fund by the first day of each month.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), an employee-beneficiary's monthly contribution to the fund shall include the amount that would have been the employee-beneficiary's contribution if the employee-beneficiary had not elected to participate in the cafeteria plan.
