Upon such a cancellation or failure to renew the franchise agreement, the party canceling or failing to renew the franchise agreement, at the dealer's option, shall either:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tCompensate the dealer at the fair market going business value for the dealer's capital investment, which shall include but not be limited to the going business value of the business, goodwill, property, and improvement owned or leased by the dealer for the purpose of the franchise, inventory of parts, and motor vehicles possessed by the dealer in connection with the franchise, plus reasonable attorney's fees incurred in collecting compensation; provided that the investment shall have been made with reasonable and prudent judgment for the purpose of the franchise agreement; or\n\t\t\t(ii)\tCompensate the dealer for damages including attorney's fees as aforesaid, resulting from the cancellation or failure to renew the franchise agreement.\n\nAs used in this paragraph, \"good faith\" means the duty of each party to any franchise agreement to fully comply with that agreement, or to act in a fair and equitable manner towards each other; \n\t\t(D)\tHas delayed delivery of or refused to deliver without cause, any new motor vehicle to a dealer, franchised to sell the new motor vehicle, within a reasonable time after receipt of a written order for the vehicle from the dealer.  The delivery to another dealer of a motor vehicle of the same model and similarly equipped as the vehicle ordered by a dealer who has not received delivery thereof, but who had placed the written order for the vehicle prior to the order of the dealer receiving the vehicle, shall be prima facie evidence of a delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a new motor vehicle without cause.  The nondelivery of a new motor vehicle to a dealer within sixty days after receipt of a written order for the vehicle from a dealer shall also be prima facie evidence of delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a new motor vehicle without cause; provided that the delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a motor vehicle shall be deemed with cause if the manufacturer establishes that the delay or refusal to deliver is due to a shortage or curtailment of material, labor, transportation, utility service, labor or production difficulty, or other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of the manufacturer;\n\t\t(E)\tHas discriminated against any of their franchised dealers in the State by directly or indirectly charging the dealer more for a new motor vehicle or services, parts, or accessories or a higher rate of transportation for transporting the vehicle from the manufacturing or assembly plant to the dealer or any portion of the distance, than is charged to any other of their franchised dealers in the State for the same make, model, and year of a new motor vehicle or for the same devices, parts, or accessories for the similar transportation for the vehicle during the same period.  A manufacturer or distributor who provides or causes to be provided greater transportation benefits for a new motor vehicle as aforesaid to any of their franchised dealers in the State than is provided to any of their competing franchised dealers in the State for the same or lesser price or charge than that imposed upon the franchised dealer in the State during the same period is deemed to have so discriminated against the competing franchised dealer in the State.  Evidence of similar discriminatory practice against franchised dealers in other states shall not constitute a defense to or justification of the commission of the discriminatory act against the franchised dealer in the State.  The intent and purpose of this subparagraph is to eliminate inequitable pricing policies set by manufacturers or distributors which result in higher prices of new motor vehicles to the consumer in the State.  This subparagraph shall be liberally interpreted to effect its intent and purpose and in the application thereof, the substance and effect and not the form of the acts and transactions shall be primarily considered in determining whether a discriminatory act has been committed.  Nothing contained in this subparagraph shall prohibit establishing delivered prices or destination charges to dealers in the State which reasonably reflect the seller's total transportation costs incurred in the manufacture or delivery of products to the dealers, including costs that are related to the geographical distances and modes of transportation involved in shipments to this State, or which meet those lower prices established by competitors;\n\t\t(F)\tHas required a dealer of new motor vehicles in the State as a condition of sale and delivery of new motor vehicles to purchase special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment not desired or requested by the dealer; provided that this prohibition shall not apply to special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment, except heaters, that are regularly installed on that particular model or new motor vehicles as \"standard\" equipment or to special features, appliances, accessories, or equipment that are an integral part of the new motor vehicles and cannot be removed therefrom without substantial expense.  Nothing in this subparagraph shall make it unlawful for a dealer to sell a vehicle that includes a heater that has been installed as standard equipment;\n\t\t(G)\tHas failed to adequately and fairly compensate its dealers for labor, parts, and other expenses incurred by the dealer to perform under and comply with manufacturer's warranty agreements. In no event shall any manufacturer or distributor pay its dealers a labor rate per hour for warranty work that is less than that charged by the dealer to the retail customers of the dealer nor shall the rates be more than the retail rates.  All claims made by the dealers for compensation for delivery, preparation, and warranty work shall be paid within thirty days after approval and shall be approved or disapproved within thirty days after receipt.  When any claim is disapproved, the dealer shall be notified in writing of the grounds for disapproval;\n\t\t(H)\tHas wilfully failed to affix the vehicle bumper impact notice pursuant to section 437-4.5(a), or wilfully misstated any information in the notice.  Each failure or misstatement is a separate offense;\n\t\t(I)\tHas wilfully defaced, or removed the vehicle bumper impact notice required by section 437-4.5(a) prior to delivery of the vehicle to which the notice is required to be affixed to the registered owner or lessee.  Each wilful defacement, alteration, or removal is a separate offense; or\n\t\t(J)\tHas required a dealer to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of, any other line of new motor vehicle or related products; provided that the new motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicle, remains in compliance with reasonable facilities and other franchise requirements of the manufacturer or distributor, and makes no unauthorized change in the principal management of the dealer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(b)  For disregard of an order suspending a license pursuant to section 436B-23, the board may summarily take possession of and impound all motor vehicles belonging to or in the possession of the licensee whether or not the vehicles are situated upon the licensed premises, pending final action in this case or, without taking possession of the motor vehicles, may render them unusable; provided that the right of the board to take any action and any liens for towing or storage or otherwise arising from the action are subject to and subordinate to any security interest that has attached to the motor vehicles prior thereto, and the board, prior to taking any action, shall give notice thereof to any secured party whose security interest in the motor vehicles is known to the board or who, prior to any action by the board, had filed a financing statement covering the motor vehicles or had noted the lien on the legal ownership certificates thereof.\n\t(c)  Any fine imposed by the board after a hearing in accordance with chapter 91 shall be no less than $100 nor no more than $1,000 for each violation.\n\t(d)  In lieu of or in addition to the fine imposed under this section, the board may require the motor vehicle dealer to make restitution to the customer.  Restitution may be imposed in lieu of a fine even though the amount may exceed the fine set forth in subsection (c).
