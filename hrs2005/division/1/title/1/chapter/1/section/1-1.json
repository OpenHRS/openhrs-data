Rent already due is personalty.  56 H. 295, 535 P.2d 1109.\n  Common law rule for use of ancient documents as evidence construed.  57 H. 312, 555 P.2d 495.\n  Joint owners of an animal may be liable in an action for injuries caused by such animal.  57 H. 620, 562 P.2d 779.\n  No evidence that \"Hawaiian usage\" gave to owner of land along seashore title to lava extensions created by volcanic eruption. 58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725.\n  \"Hawaiian usage\" must predate November\u00a025, 1892.  58 H. 106, 566 P.2d 725.\n  Where practices have, without harm to anyone, been continued, reference to Hawaiian usage in section insures their continuance for so long as no actual harm is done thereby.  Retention of a Hawaiian tradition should in each case be determined by balancing respective interests and harm once it is established that application of the custom has continued in a particular area.  66 H. 1, 656 P.2d 745.\n  \"Hawaiian usage\" clause may establish certain customary Hawaiian rights beyond those found in section 7-1.  73 H. 578, 837 P.2d 1247.\n  Common law rights ordinarily associated with tenancy do not limit customary rights existing under the laws of Hawaii.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n  Descendants of native Hawaiians who inhabited islands prior to 1778 who assert valid customary and traditional Hawaiian rights under this section entitled to protection regardless of their blood quantum.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n  Hawaii constitution and this section require county planning commission to \"preserve and protect\" reasonable exercise of customary or traditional native Hawaiian rights to the extent feasible when issuing special management area use permits.  79 H. 425, 903 P.2d 1246.\n  If property is deemed \"fully developed\", i.e., lands zoned and used for residential purposes with existing dwellings, improvements, and infrastructure, it is always \"inconsistent\" to permit the practice of traditional and customary native Hawaiian rights on such property.  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n  To establish the existence of a traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice, there must be an adequate foundation in the record connecting the claimed right to a firmly rooted traditional or customary native Hawaiian practice.  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\n  Where defendant failed to adduce sufficient evidence to support claim of the exercise of a constitutionally protected native Hawaiian right and knowingly entered landowner\u0092s property which was fenced in a manner to exclude others, trial court properly concluded that defendant was unlawfully on property in violation of \u00a7708-814(1).  89 H. 177, 970 P.2d 485.\nCriminal Law and Procedure.\n  See also notes under Effect of Common Law on Statutory Construction.\n  No common law offenses.  4 H. 39; 10 H. 469, 472; 11 H. 293, 300.\n  Elements of offense where not defined, resort to common law.  25 H. 814.\n  Whether corroboration of accomplice required, governed by common law.  45 H. 16, 42, 361 P.2d 45.\n  Leave of court required for a nol. pros.  6 H. 718.
