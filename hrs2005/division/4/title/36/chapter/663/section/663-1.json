Supp. 1523.\nBad faith.\n  Hawaii supreme court, seeking to avoid inequitable or absurd result, would allow plaintiff's bad faith claim, where plaintiff submitted claims to defendant insurer for losses suffered as a third-party beneficiary of insurance contract.  947 F. Supp. 429.\n  Independent cause of action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing would not lie, where there was no coverage liability on underlying insurance policy.  955 F. Supp. 1218.\n  Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (\u00a7657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of \u00a7657-1 (\u00a7657-1(4)).  986 F. Supp. 1334.\n  Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.  \n  Violations of the unfair settlement provision, \u00a7431:13-103(a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co.  27 F. Supp. 2d 1211.\n  Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided to plaintiff by chapter 386; prior to filing a separate suit for bad faith denial of benefits or payments, plaintiff must first exhaust all available administrative remedies before the department of labor and industrial relations, disability compensation division.  28 F. Supp. 2d 588.\n  Insurer's motion granted to extent it sought summary judgment as to claims against defendant, where uncontradicted evidence was that defendant was the claims handler for subject insurance policy;  defendant did not have a contract with plaintiffs; defendant could not be liable to plaintiffs for bad faith.  74 F. Supp. 2d 975.\n  Insurer's motion for summary judgment granted on defendant's counterclaim alleging that insurer acted in tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its failure to pay underinsured motorist policy benefits, improper use of \"excuse\" that defendant violated consent-to-settle clause, and wrongful pursuit of its offset theory.  176 F. Supp. 2d 1005.\n  Hawaii's Best Place bad faith tort is law that impacts insurance, but does not solely regulate it; therefore, plaintiff's claim as stated arising under Best Place bad faith tort did not fit within Employee Retirement Income Security Act's (ERISA) saving clause.  Controlling precedent mandated that plaintiff's claim was related to the processing of a claim and was preempted by ERISA because ERISA's civil remedy was plaintiff's sole avenue of relief.  242 F. Supp. 2d 752.\n  Where insured alleged that insurer breached covenant of good faith and fair dealing by initiating action for declaratory judgment, insured would be unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that insurer's filing of lawsuit was based on an interpretation of disability insurance policy that was unreasonable; among other things, a reasonable jury could decide issue of fraud in insurer's favor based upon insured's failure to include 1990 surgery on insured's application for the policy.  248 F. Supp. 2d 974.\n  Insurance company did not breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it decided not to defend the operator of a concrete recycling plant or indemnify the owner where, inter alia, it appeared that plaintiffs did not disagree with insurance company's assertion that at a minimum, there was a genuine dispute as to whether coverage existed under the insurance policy.  307 F. Supp. 2d 1170.\n  Bad faith cause of action may be brought by first-party insured for insurer misconduct.  82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.\n  Breach of implied contractual duties owed by workers' compensation insurer to employee, including duty to handle and pay claims in good faith, gives rise to independent tort cause of action by employee, the intended third-party beneficiary.  83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.\n  Where insured presented evidence that raised genuine issue of material fact as to insurer's liability for bad faith if insurer's law firm's conduct of defense breached law firm's duties towards insured and breach was causally induced by insurer's actions, summary judgment erroneously entered in favor of insurer on insured's bad faith claim.  90 H. 39, 975 P.2d 1159.\n  Any formal recognition of a claim for relief in favor of an injured claimant against a third-party tortfeasor's insurance company for bad faith settlement practices would require the assignment of the insured tortfeasor's rights arising from an underlying insurance contract to the injured plaintiff; the tort of bad faith settlement practices arises only from a contract of insurance.  105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.\n  Where there was no underlying insurance contract from which the duty of good faith settlement practices could arise, injured third-party claimant had no right to sue self-insured car rental company for bad faith.  105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.\n  As action for bad faith against insurer is an independent tort, the proper limitation provision for bringing an action should not be that provided in the insurance policy, but rather that provided in \u00a7657-7, which limits causes of action for torts to two years.  88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639.\n  Where insured's bad faith claim was not \"any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing\" under \u00a7658-5, and action for bad faith in the first-party insurance context is independent of the policy, an ongoing appraisal process did not bar insured from bringing a lawsuit alleging bad faith handling of insured's claim.  88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639.\nChildren.\n  Parent liable for tort of minor child when child would be liable.  15 H. 124; 23 H. 541, 543.  Father not liable for act of infant unemancipated from childish instincts.  8 H. 715.  Liability of infant for damages to hired chattel resulting from infant's immoderate use of the chattel.  8 H. 237.  Contributory negligence of mother of six-year old child not imputed to child. 29 H. 604.  See 47 H. 281, 287, 386 P.2d 872.  Degree of care toward children on highway.  40 H. 417.\n  Child has no cause of action for injuries to parent not resulting in death.  41 H. 634; 244 F.2d 604.\n  A six-year old may be capable of contributory negligence; minor's standard of care.  47 H. 281, 386 P.2d 872.\n  Minor children liable in tort to parents, when.  51 H. 74, 450 P.2d 998.  Minor children may sue their parents for negligence.  51 H. 484, 462 P.2d 1007.\n  Negligence; standard of care for children.  54 H. 611, 513 P.2d 487.\n  Parent may recover damages for loss of filial consortium of an injured adult child.  71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\nCausation.\n  Motion to dismiss count of plaintiffs' third amended complaint alleging that the design, manufacture, and/or production of subject chemicals by certain defendants constituted an ultrahazardous activity granted; the complaint was devoid of any allegation that plaintiffs' claimed injuries flowed directly from the act of manufacturing the subject chemicals, nor could plaintiffs make such causation allegations.  293 F. Supp. 2d 1140.\n  Intervening negligence and proximate causation.  45 H. 128, 363 P.2d 969.\n  Negligence.  Causation construed.  57 H. 460, 558 P.2d 1018.\n  Where causation is a primary issue, it is plain and reversible error for a trial court not to explain the meaning of \"legal cause\" to a jury.  77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.\n  When read as a whole, or when considering both jury instruction where trial court used term \"legal cause\" as opposed to \"substantial factor\" and instruction that properly defined \"legal cause\", the instructions given were not prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.  78 H. 230, 891 P.2d 1022.\n  Where department of education's (DOE) negligent acts contributed to the conditions that facilitated the teacher's molestation of the girl students, the DOE's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff parents' injuries; thus, trial court did not err in finding that the DOE's negligence legally caused the plaintiff parents' various psychological injuries.  100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545.\n  In breach of express warranty actions based on seller's failure to deliver goods in conformance with an express promise, affirmation of fact, or description, \"substantial factor\" test proper standard to apply in determining proximate cause.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\nDamages.\n  Defendant insurance company's motion for summary judgment granted as to plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, where plaintiff alleged that defendant's conduct was wanton and oppressive; there was not sufficient evidence to reach clear and convincing standard, and thus the question of punitives could not be put to a jury.  999 F. Supp. 1369.\n  If plaintiff succeeded on bad faith claim, and plaintiff could show that plaintiff's emotional distress damages were proximately caused by defendant insurance company's actions, plaintiff could recover damages for plaintiff's emotional distress as incidentally flowing from the breach.  999 F. Supp. 1369.\n  Any recovery of damages for loss of consortium by (former) spouse limited to duration of plaintiffs' (i.e., patient and patient's spouse) marriage.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1249.\n  Defendant entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims due to their inability to prove either the fact or amount of damages with reasonable certainty.  330 F. Supp. 2d 1101.\n  Punitive damages not allowed against principal unless principal participated in the wrongful act or authorized or approved it.  8 H. 411; 24 H. 579; 29 H. 524.  Punitive damages may be awarded though actual damages nominal.  40 H. 492.\n  Explosives, concussion damage.  42 H. 353.\n  Use of mathematical formula to compute damages for pain and suffering improper.  47 H. 408, 390 P.2d 740; 48 H. 22, 395 P.2d 365.  But see \u00a7635-52.\n  Defendant title company was liable to plaintiffs only for damages limited to the transaction for which certificate of title search was intended to influence, that is, only for damages plaintiffs suffered in the transaction wherein they purchased the property; defendant's negligence was not the proximate cause of the loss of anticipated profits.  51 H. 462, 462 P.2d 905.\n  Clear and convincing standard of proof adopted for all punitive damage claims.  71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\n  Punitive damages may be awarded in products liability action based on underlying theory of strict liability where plaintiff proves requisite aggravating conduct on part of defendant.  71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\n  Plaintiff has duty to mitigate damages.  56 H. 507, 542 P.2d 1265.\n  Mental distress damages may be recovered in a products liability implied warranty action.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.\n  Apportionment of damages, discussed, where plaintiff had a pre-existing condition, had been injured or plaintiff's condition had been aggravated by independent acts of successive tortfeasors, and had allegedly caused some of plaintiff's own injuries after the accident from which plaintiff had brought suit.  77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.\n  Circuit court correctly granted plaintiff-appellee's motion for directed verdict as to punitive damages regarding interference with contract claim, where defendants-appellants failed to show actual damages.  78 H. 40, 890 P.2d 277.\n  Punitive damages may not be awarded in bad faith tort case unless evidence reflects something more than the conduct necessary to establish the tort.  82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.\n  Emotional distress damages resulting from breach of contract recoverable only where parties specifically provide for them in the contract or where the nature of the contract clearly indicates that such damages are within the parties' contemplation or expectation in the event of a breach.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.\n  Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that (1) violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law and (2) transcends the breach of the contract.  89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.\n  Where plaintiff alleging defamation failed to prove \"actual damages\" caused by newspaper's negligence, summary judgment for newspaper properly granted.  89 H. 254, 971 P.2d 1089.\n  Where a person is deprived of the use of his or her property due to the tortious conduct of another, he or she may recover \"loss of use\" damages; such damages are, as a general matter, limited to the period of time reasonably necessary to obtain a replacement, to effect repairs, or the date upon which the property is returned.  97 H. 38, 33 P.3d 204.\n  Under Hawaii law, a party is not immune from liability for civil damages based upon that party's fraud engaged in during prior litigation proceedings.  102 H. 149, 73 P.3d 687.\n  Where award of general damages, consisting of damages to credit, general reputation, and loss of business opportunities, were personal to aircraft lessors, appellate court erred by holding that general damages were assignable.  102 H. 189, 74 P.3d 12.\n  The collateral source rule prohibits reducing a plaintiff's award of medical special damages to reflect the discounted amount paid by Medicare/Medicaid; the amounts billed in excess of the Medicare/Medicaid amount paid are not irrelevant or inadmissible on the issue of medical special damages.  106 H. 81, 101 P.3d 1149.\n  Inconsistent for jury not to award pain and suffering general damages where it awarded special damages for medical expenses and lost wages.  80 H. 188 (App.), 907 P.2d 774.\n  \"Pure\" comparative negligence principles should be applied to reduce a plaintiff's recovery in those tort actions for breach of express warranty where a plaintiff is found to be negligent.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\nDefamation.\n  Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client representation constitutionally protected speech and not defamatory where general and specific contexts in which statements were made did not imply assertion of an objective fact and statements were incapable of being proved true or false.  56 F.3d 1147.\n  Totality of the circumstances revealed that statements by president of labor organization were a call to arms, not assertions of objective fact; the statements were not defamatory, and therefore were fully protected by federal labor law.  302 F.3d 998.\n  False statement that attorney had been a prosecutor in South Africa was libelous per se; no recovery for defamation based on a truthful statement of fact.  825 F. Supp. 906.\n  Some statements that allegedly defamed plaintiff or cast plaintiff in false light were privileged expressions of opinion.  825 F. Supp. 906.\n  Plaintiff was not a public figure for purposes of its defamation claim.  833 F. Supp. 802.\n  Statements in editorial about plaintiff (when plaintiff was mayor) were protected by First Amendment and thus, not actionable.  930 F. Supp. 1403.\n  Where alleged defamatory statements occurred during a conversation between an employee of defendant and representatives of defendant's temporary disability insurer, there was a qualified privilege as defendant and its insurer shared a common interest, their business relationship; an employer who communicates information to its insurance carrier is acting, at the very least, to promote the private interest of the companies; questions remained regarding potential abuse of the privilege.  26 F. Supp. 2d 1241.  Defendant magazine's motion for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, for summary judgment granted, where, inter alia, plaintiff complained of general taint of magazine article and plaintiff's complaint also identified specific statements in the article that plaintiff took to be defamatory.  190 F. Supp. 2d 1192.\n  Preemption by Fair Credit Reporting Act of plaintiff's defamation and negligence claims against furnishers of credit information and consumer reporting agencies, discussed.  293 F.

Supp. 1334.\n  It could not be disputed that by the time the underinsured motorist benefits were paid, plaintiff either knew or should have known that defendant's alleged refusal to engage in settlement negotiations caused plaintiff injury; any claims for emotional distress were time-barred.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.\n  Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.  11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.  \n  Plaintiffs' claims against certain defendants were time-barred, where those defendants were first named as parties in first amended complaint filed more than two years after plane crash and the claims did not relate back to the date the original complaint was filed.  289 F. Supp. 2d 1197.\n  Plaintiffs' negligence claims were dismissed with prejudice; there was no basis for allowing derivative litigation over claims that an opponent's prior litigation conduct in another case amounted to negligence.  330 F. Supp. 2d 1101.\n  Contributory negligence.  48 H. 22, 395 P.2d 365.  Assumption of risk.  49 H. 1, 406 P.2d 887; 49 H. 351, 417 P.2d 816. Unavoidable accident.  47 H. 408, 390 P.2d 740; 48 H. 330, 402 P.2d 289.\n  Comparative negligence applies only to claims accruing after July 14, 1969, and the rule of contributory negligence continues on claims that accrued before that date.  52 H. 129, 471 P.2d 524.\n  Interspousal tort immunity upheld.  63 H. 653, 634 P.2d 586.\n  In implied warranty and strict products liability tort actions, express assumption of risk is available as separate defense that may bar recovery; implied assumption of risk is defense only when plaintiff's assumption of risk is a form of contributory negligence.  74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.\n  Assumption of risk defense generally applied to tort claims for relief.  74 H. 85, 839 P.2d 10.\n  Compelled self-publication of the reason for termination by a former employee to prospective employers does not satisfy the requirement of publication to a third party necessary to sustain a claim for defamation.  100 H. 149, 58 P.3d 1196.\n  UCC statute of limitations applies to breach of express warranty claim for personal injury.  86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n  Primary implied assumption of risk is a discrete and complete defense in sports injury cases where the defendant's conduct at issue is an inherent risk of the sports activity; in determining whether the defendant's conduct is an inherent risk of the sports activity, the nature of the activity, the relationship of the defendant to the activity and the relationship of the defendant to the plaintiff must be considered.  96 H. 51 (App.), 25 P.3d 826.\nDram shop.\n  Person injured by intoxicated person may recover from tavern which supplied liquor to the intoxicated person in violation of statute.  62 H. 131, 612 P.2d 533.\nDuty.\n  Plaintiff failed to demonstrate facts to establish duty owed by defendant, where, inter alia, no evidence found of custody or control of plaintiff's employer's machinery or employees that would create special relationship between defendant and plaintiff's employer or plaintiff.  863 F. Supp. 1193.\n  In case arising out of alleged assault on airplane, tort claim for breach of duty of reasonable care preempted by Airlines Deregulation Act.  905 F. Supp. 823.\n  Evidence demonstrated that plaintiffs had never had a relationship with defendant; without a relationship between plaintiffs and defendant, there could be no legal duty.  920 F. Supp. 1080.\n  Defendant, which acted as custodian, granted summary judgment on counts where plaintiff alleged that defendant acted in a negligent or grossly negligent manner by permitting securities to be substituted into custodial account and by releasing cash as alleged.  30 F. Supp. 2d 1255.\n  Plaintiff's negligence claim failed as a matter of law; there was no \"duty\" to not arrest without probable cause.  127 F.
