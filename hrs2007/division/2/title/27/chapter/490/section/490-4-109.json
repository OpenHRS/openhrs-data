[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-108; HRS \u00a7490:4-108; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Sections 4-202(2), 4-212, 4-301 and 4-302 prescribe various time limits for the handling of items.\u00a0 These are the limits of time within which a bank, in fulfilment of its obligation to exercise ordinary care, must handle items entrusted to it for collection or payment.\u00a0 Under Section 4-103 they may be varied by agreement or by Federal Reserve regulations or operating letters, clearing house rules, or the like.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (1) of this section permits a limited extension of these time limits in special cases.\u00a0 It permits collecting banks to grant, within a rather narrow field, an additional banking day and to do so with or without the approval of any interested party.\u00a0 Such one-day extension can only be granted in a good faith effort to secure payment and only with respect to specific items.\u00a0 It cannot be exercised if the customer instructs otherwise.\u00a0 Thus limited the escape provision should afford a limited degree of flexibility in special cases but should not interfere with the overall requirement and objective of speedy collections.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Notice that an extension granted under Subsection (1) is \"without discharge of secondary parties\".\u00a0 It therefore extends also the times for presentment or payment, as the case may be, specified in Article 3.\u00a0 See Sections 3-503 and 3-506.\u00a0 Where this Article and Article 3 conflict, this Article controls.\u00a0 See Sections 3-103(2) and 4-102(1).\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsection (2) is another escape clause from time limits. This clause operates not only with respect to time limits imposed by the article itself but also time limits imposed by special instructions, by agreement or by Federal Reserve regulations or operating letters, clearing house rules or the like.\u00a0 The latter time limits are \"permitted\" by the Code.\u00a0 This clause operates, however, only in the types of situation specified.\u00a0 Examples of these situations include blizzards, floods, or hurricanes, and other \"Act of God\" events or conditions, and wrecks or disasters, interfering with mails; suspension of payments by another bank; abnormal operating conditions such as substantial increased volume or substantial shortage of personnel during war or emergency situations.\u00a0 When delay is sought to be excused under this subsection the bank must \"exercise such diligence as the circumstances require\" and it has the burden of proof.\u00a0 See Section 4-202(2).\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-103(2), 3-503, 3-506, 4-102(1), 4-103, 4-104, 4-202(2), 4-212, 4-213, 4-301, 4-302.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Banking day\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
