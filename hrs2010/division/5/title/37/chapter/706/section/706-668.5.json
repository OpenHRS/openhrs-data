    "text": "(1)\u00a0 If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant, whether at the same time or at different times, or if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an unexpired term of imprisonment, the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.\u00a0 Multiple terms of imprisonment run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The court, in determining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, shall consider the factors set forth in section 706-606. [L 1986, c 314, \u00a745; am L 2008, c 193, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 193, Session Laws 2008, amended this section to promote consistency in sentencing law by requiring that multiple terms of imprisonment, whether imposed at the same time or at different times, run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms run consecutively.\u00a0 Testimony indicated that there had been some misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the sentencing law involving multiple terms of imprisonment.\u00a0 Act 193 clarified the law.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 81-08, House Standing Committee Report No. 688-08, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3337.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 State v. Kumukau:\u00a0 A Case for the Application of Eighth Amendment Proportionality Analysis.\u00a0 13 UH L. Rev. 577.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Sentencing court's imposition of consecutive prison terms pursuant to this section constituted an abuse of discretion, where court's sole purpose in imposing consecutive terms was to maximize the supervisory power of the Hawai`i paroling authority over defendant in an attempt to facilitate the collection of court-ordered restitution. \u00a078 H. 127, 890 P.2d 1167.\n\u00a0 Sentencing court did not abuse its discretion in resentencing appellant to consecutive terms of imprisonment.\u00a0 79 H. 281, 901 P.2d 481.\n\u00a0 Extraordinarily sadistic and cruel manner in which defendant committed offenses and defendant's past behavioral history required retributive, incapacitative and deterrent penal objectives of consecutive terms of imprisonment achieved under this section.\u00a0 83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.\n\u00a0 Trial court plainly erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment based on the unsubstantiated allegation that defendant had transferred a semi-automatic firearm to a drug dealer.\u00a0 106 H. 441, 106 P.3d 364.\n\u00a0 Where defendant was convicted by the jury of five first-degree thefts, each of which defendant was sentenced to ten years' incarceration, and pursuant to \u00a7706-660 and this section, five ten-year terms running consecutively was the statutory maximum, defendant's sentence did not deprive defendant of defendant's right to a jury trial as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in Apprendi and Blakely.\u00a0 111 H. 267, 141 P.3d 440.\n\u00a0 Trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under this section where, taking into consideration all of the factors set forth in \u00a7706-606, the court pointed to the high level of cruelty, violence, and viciousness involved in the commission of the offenses, that most of the offenses took place in front of defendant's two-year-old son, defendant's lack of remorse, the clear and present danger defendant posed to complainant and the community, and the poor prospects for defendant's rehabilitation.\u00a0 106 H. 365 (App.), 105 P.3d 242.\n\u00a0 Discussed:\u00a0 81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228."
