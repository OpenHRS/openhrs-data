[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-615; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This section excuses a seller from timely delivery of goods contracted for, where his performance has become commercially impracticable because of unforeseen supervening circumstances not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting.\u00a0 The destruction of specific goods and the problem of the use of substituted performance on points other than delay or quantity, treated elsewhere in this Article, must be distinguished from the matter covered by this section.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The present section deliberately refrains from any effort at an exhaustive expression of contingencies and is to be interpreted in all cases sought to be brought within its scope in terms of its underlying reason and purpose.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The first test for excuse under this Article in terms of basic assumption is a familiar one.\u00a0 The additional test of commercial impracticability (as contrasted with \"impossibility,\" \"frustration of performance\" or \"frustration of the venture\") has been adopted in order to call attention to the commercial character of the criterion chosen by this Article.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the essential nature of the performance.\u00a0 Neither is a rise or a collapse in the market in itself a justification, for that is exactly the type of business risk which business contracts made at fixed prices are intended to cover.\u00a0 But a severe shortage of raw materials or of supplies due to a contingency such as war, embargo, local crop failure, unforeseen shutdown of major sources of supply or the like, which either causes a marked increase in cost or altogether prevents the seller from securing supplies necessary to his performance, is within the contemplation of this section.\u00a0 (See Ford & Sons, Ltd., v. Henry Leetham & Sons, Ltd., 21 Com. Cas. 55 (1915, K.B.D.).)\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Where a particular source of supply is exclusive under the agreement and fails through casualty, the present section applies rather than the provision on destruction or deterioration of specific goods.\u00a0 The same holds true where a particular source of supply is shown by the circumstances to have been contemplated or assumed by the parties at the time of contracting.\u00a0 (See Davis Co. v. Hoffman-LaRoche Chemical Works, 178 App. Div. 855, 166 N.Y.S. 179 (1917) and International Paper Co. v. Rockefeller, 161 App. Div. 180, 146 N.Y.S. 371 (1914).)\u00a0 There is no excuse under this section, however, unless the seller has employed all due measures to assure himself that his source will not fail.\u00a0 (See Canadian Industrial Alcohol Co., Ltd., v. Dunbar Molasses Co., 258 N.Y. 194, 179 N.E. 383, 80 A.L.R. 1173 (1932) and Washington Mfg. Co. v. Midland Lumber Co., 113 Wash. 593, 194 P. 777 (1921).)\n\u00a0 In the case of failure of production by an agreed source for causes beyond the seller's control, the seller should, if possible, be excused since production by an agreed source is without more a basic assumption of the contract.\u00a0 Such excuse should not result in relieving the defaulting supplier from liability nor in dropping into the seller's lap an unearned bonus of damages over.\u00a0 The flexible adjustment machinery of this Article provides the solution under the provision on the obligation of good faith.\u00a0 A condition to his making good the claim of excuse is the turning over to the buyer of his rights against the defaulting source of supply to the extent of the buyer's contract in relation to which excuse is being claimed.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 In situations in which neither sense nor justice is served by either answer when the issue is posed in flat terms of \"excuse\" or \"no excuse,\" adjustment under the various provisions of this Article is necessary, especially the sections on good faith, on insecurity and assurance and on the reading of all provisions in the light of their purposes, and the general policy of this Act to use equitable principles in furtherance of commercial standards and good faith.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 The failure of conditions which go to convenience or collateral values rather than to the commercial practicability of the main performance does not amount to a complete excuse.\u00a0 However, good faith and the reason of the present section and of the preceding one may properly be held to justify and even to require any needed delay involved in a good faith inquiry seeking a readjustment of the contract terms to meet the new conditions.\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 The provisions of this section are made subject to assumption of greater liability by agreement and such agreement is to be found not only in the expressed terms of the contract but in the circumstances surrounding the contracting, in trade usage and the like.\u00a0 Thus the exemptions of this section do not apply when the contingency in question is sufficiently foreshadowed at the time of contracting to be included among the business risks which are fairly to be regarded as part of the dickered terms, either consciously or as a matter of reasonable, commercial interpretation from the circumstances.\u00a0 (See Madeirense Do Brasil, S. A. v. Stulman-Emrick Lumber Co., 147 F.2d 399 (C.C.A., 2 Cir., 1945).)\u00a0 The exemption otherwise present through usage of trade under the present section may also be expressly negated by the language of the agreement.\u00a0 Generally, express agreements as to exemptions designed to enlarge upon or supplant the provisions of this section are to be read in the light of mercantile sense and reason, for this section itself sets up the commercial standard for normal and reasonable interpretation and provides a minimum beyond which agreement may not go.\n\u00a0 Agreement can also be made in regard to the consequences of exemption as laid down in paragraphs (b) and (c) and the next section on procedure on notice claiming excuse.\n\u00a0 9.\u00a0 The case of a farmer who has contracted to sell crops to be grown on designated land may be regarded as falling either within the section on casualty to identified goods or this section, and he may be excused, when there is a failure of the specific crop, either on the basis of the destruction of identified goods or because of the failure of a basic assumption of the contract.\n\u00a0 Exemption of the buyer in the case of a \"requirements\" contract is covered by the \"Output and Requirements\" section both as to assumption and allocation of the relevant risks.\u00a0 But when a contract by a manufacturer to buy fuel or raw material makes no specific reference to a particular venture and no such reference may be drawn from the circumstances, commercial understanding views it as a general deal in the general market and not conditioned on any assumption of the continuing operation of the buyer's plant.\u00a0 Even when notice is given by the buyer that the supplies are needed to fill a specific contract of a normal commercial kind, commercial understanding does not see such a supply contract as conditioned on the continuance of the buyer's further contract for outlet.\u00a0 On the other hand, where the buyer's contract is in reasonable commercial understanding conditioned on a definite and specific venture or assumption as, for instance, a war procurement subcontract known to be based on a prime contract which is subject to termination, or a supply contract for a particular construction venture, the reason of the present section may well apply and entitle the buyer to the exemption.\n\u00a0 10.\u00a0 Following its basic policy of using commercial practicability as a test for excuse, this section recognizes as of equal significance either a foreign or domestic regulation and disregards any technical distinctions between \"law,\" \"regulation,\" \"order\" and the like.\u00a0 Nor does it make the present action of the seller depend upon the eventual judicial determination of the legality of the particular governmental action.\u00a0 The seller's good faith belief in the validity of the regulation is the test under this Article and the best evidence of his good faith is the general commercial acceptance of the regulation.\u00a0 However, governmental interference cannot excuse unless it truly \"supervenes\" in such a manner as to be beyond the seller's assumption of risk.\u00a0 And any action by the party claiming excuse which causes or colludes in inducing the governmental action preventing his performance would be in breach of good faith and would destroy his exemption.\n\u00a0 11.\u00a0 An excused seller must fulfill his contract to the extent which the supervening contingency permits, and if the situation is such that his customers are generally affected he must take account of all in supplying one.\u00a0 Subsections (a) and (b), therefore, explicitly permit in any proration a fair and reasonable attention to the needs of regular customers who are probably relying on spot orders for supplies.\u00a0 Customers at different stages of the manufacturing process may be fairly treated by including the seller's manufacturing requirements.\u00a0 A fortiori, the seller may also take account of contracts later in date than the one in question.\u00a0 The fact that such spot orders may be closed at an advanced price causes no difficulty, since any allocation which exceeds normal past requirements will not be reasonable.\u00a0 However, good faith requires, when prices have advanced, that the seller exercise real care in making his allocations, and in case of doubt his contract customers should be favored and supplies prorated evenly among them regardless of price.\u00a0 Save for the extra care thus required by changes in the market, this section seeks to leave every reasonable business leeway to the seller.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Sections 2-613 and 2-614.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Section 1-102.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Sections 1-203 and
