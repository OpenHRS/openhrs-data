The morbidity data may be collected in cooperation with the Hawaii state medical association and the Hawaii cancer society.  The mortality data as collected from death certificates shall be analyzed by the staff of the department in order to determine the significance of cancer in the State by race, sex, age, occupation, site in the body, and in any other way found desirable for the purpose of determining the areas where greatest emphasis should be laid in the statewide cancer control program.  The morbidity data shall be used in determining the prognosis and chance of cure, as well as the number of persons cured of cancer in the State; for assisting in the direction of tumor research; for determining, if possible, the tendencies of benign tumors to become malignant; and for assisting in the follow-up of diagnosed or treated tumor cases as requested by attending physicians.  All statistical material collected under this section shall be considered confidential as to the names of persons or physicians concerned, except that researchers may use the names of such persons when requesting additional information for research studies when such studies have been approved by the cancer commission of the Hawaii medical association.
