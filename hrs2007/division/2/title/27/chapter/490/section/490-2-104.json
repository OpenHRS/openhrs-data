[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-104; HRS ; am L 2004, c 163, \u00a75]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\u00a0 But see Sections 15(2), (5), 16(c), 45(2) and 71, Uniform Sales Act, and Sections 35 and 37, Uniform Bills of Lading Act for examples of the policy expressly provided for in this Article.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This Article assumes that transactions between professionals in a given field require special and clear rules which may not apply to a casual or inexperienced seller or buyer.\u00a0 It thus adopts a policy of expressly stating rules applicable \"between merchants\" and \"as against a merchant\", wherever they are needed instead of making them depend upon the circumstances of each case as in the statutes cited above.\u00a0 This section lays the foundation of this policy by defining those who are to be regarded as professionals or \"merchants\" and by stating when a transaction is deemed to be \"between merchants\".\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The term \"merchant\" as defined here roots in the \"law merchant\" concept of a professional in business.\u00a0 The professional status under the definition may be based upon specialized knowledge as to the goods, specialized knowledge as to business practices, or specialized knowledge as to both and which kind of specialized knowledge may be sufficient to establish the merchant status is indicated by the nature of the provisions.\n\u00a0 The special provisions as to merchants appear only in this Article and they are of three kinds.\u00a0 Sections 2-201(2), 2-205, 2-207 and 2-209 dealing with the statute of frauds, firm offers, confirmatory memoranda and modification rest on normal business practices which are or ought to be typical of and familiar to any person in business.\u00a0 For purposes of these sections almost every person in business would, therefore, be deemed to be a \"merchant\" under the language \"who...by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices...involved in the transaction...\" since the practices involved in the transaction are non-specialized business practices such as answering mail.\u00a0 In this type of provision, banks or even universities, for example, well may be \"merchants.\"\u00a0 But even these sections only apply to a merchant in his mercantile capacity; a lawyer or bank president buying fishing tackle for his own use is not a merchant.\n\u00a0 On the other hand, in Section 2-314 on the warranty of merchantability, such warranty is implied only \"if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\"\u00a0 Obviously this qualification restricts the implied warranty to a much smaller group than everyone who is engaged in business and requires a professional status as to particular kinds of goods.\u00a0 The exception in Section 2-402(2) for retention of possession by a merchant-seller falls in the same class; as does Section 2-403(2) on entrusting of possession to a merchant \"who deals in goods of that kind\".\n\u00a0 A third group of sections includes 2-103(1)(b), which provides that in the case of a merchant \"good faith\" includes observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade; 2-327(1)(c), 2-603 and 2-605, dealing with responsibilities of merchant buyers to follow seller's instructions, etc.; 2-509 on risk of loss, and 2-609 on adequate assurance of performance.\u00a0 This group of sections applies to persons who are merchants under either the \"practices\" or the \"goods\" aspect of the definition of merchant.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The \"or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker...\" clause of the definition of merchant means that even persons such as universities, for example, can come within the definition of merchant if they have regular purchasing departments or business personnel who are familiar with business practices and who are equipped to take any action required.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 See Sections 1-102 and 1-203.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 See Sections 2-314, 2-315 and 2-320 to 2-325, of this Article, and Article 9.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Document of title\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Draft\".\u00a0 Section 3-104.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Person\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Purchase\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Restaurant in business for two years was a merchant.\u00a0 691 F.
