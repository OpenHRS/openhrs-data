    "text": "Before the county shall be liable for damages to any person for injuries to person or property received upon any of the streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, or other public places of the county, or on account of any negligence of any official or employee of the county, the person injured, or the owner or person entitled to the possession, occupation, or use of the property injured, or someone on the person's behalf, within two years after the injuries accrued shall give the individual identified in the respective county's charter, or if none is specified, the chairperson of the council of the county or the clerk of the county in which the injuries occurred, notice in writing of the injuries and the specific damages resulting, stating fully when, where, and how the injuries or damage occurred, the extent of the injuries or damages, and the amount claimed.

Supp. 854.\n\u00a0 This is a statute of limitations and is to be narrowly construed.\u00a0 283 F. Supp. 854.\n\u00a0 Sufficiency of notice of claim discussed.\u00a0 54 H. 210, 505 P.2d 1182.\n\u00a0 Notice of claim requirement is inconsistent with \u00a7662-4 and is invalid.\u00a0 55 H. 216, 517 P.2d 51; 56 H. 135, 531 P.2d 648.\n\u00a0 Because the city is neither the sovereign nor the surrogate or alter ego of the sovereign, it is not entitled to sovereign immunity; thus, it is subject to the State's tort laws in the same manner as any private tortfeasor; as \u00a7657-13 governs classes of \"personal\" tort actions, such as \"damage to persons or property\", the infancy tolling provision of \u00a7657-13(1) applies directly to personal injury actions against the city; child was thus able to bring action, but as \u00a7657-13(1) did not provide for tolling of parents' derivative actions and they did not timely comply with this section, their individual claims were barred.\u00a0 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233.\n\u00a0 Counties do not fall within the ambit of the State Tort Liability Act, chapter 662; this section is the statute of limitations applicable to actions against the counties.\u00a0 104 H. 341, 90 P.3d 233."
