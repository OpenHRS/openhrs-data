    "text": "(a)  If a member desires to withdraw from the association or dispose of any or all of the member's holdings therein, the directors shall have the power to purchase those holdings by paying the member out of surplus funds the par value or book value, whichever is less, of any or all of the holdings offered.  The directors shall then reissue or cancel the holdings. \t(b)  If the association fails, within ninety days of the original offer, to purchase all or any part of the holdings offered, the member may dispose of the unpurchased interest elsewhere, subject to the approval of the transferee by a majority vote of the directors.  Any prospective transferee not approved by the directors may appeal to the members at their first regular or special meeting thereafter, and the action of the meeting shall be final.  If such transferee is not approved, the directors shall exercise their power to purchase, if and when there are sufficient surplus funds.\n\t(c)  Members who withdraw from an association under this section may not rejoin that association for six months except with the majority approval of the directors.
