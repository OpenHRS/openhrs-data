[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-209; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Prior Uniform Statutory Provisions:\u00a0 Subsection (1) - Compare Section 1, Uniform Written Obligations Act; Subsections (2) to (5) - none.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes and New\nMatter:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This section seeks to protect and make effective all necessary and desirable modifications of sales contracts without regard to the technicalities which at present hamper such adjustments.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides that an agreement modifying a sales contract needs no consideration to be binding.\n\u00a0 However, modifications made thereunder must meet the test of good faith imposed by this Act.\u00a0 The effective use of bad faith to escape performance on the original contract terms is barred, and the extortion of a \"modification\" without legitimate commercial reason is ineffective as a violation of the duty of good faith.\u00a0 Nor can a mere technical consideration support a modification made in bad faith.\n\u00a0 The test of \"good faith\" between merchants or as against merchants includes \"observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade\" (Section 2-103), and may in some situations require an objectively demonstrable reason for seeking a modification.\u00a0 But such matters as a market shift which makes performance come to involve a loss may provide such a reason even though there is no such unforeseen difficulty as would make out a legal excuse from performance under Sections 2-615 and 2-616.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsections (2) and (3) are intended to protect against false allegations of oral modifications.\u00a0 \"Modification or rescission\" includes abandonment or other change by mutual consent, contrary to the decision in Green v. Doniger, 300 N.Y. 238, 90 N.E. 2d 56 (1949); it does not include unilateral \"termination\" or \"cancellation\" as defined in Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 The Statute of Frauds provisions of this Article are expressly applied to modifications by subsection (3).\u00a0 Under those provisions the \"delivery and acceptance\" test is limited to the goods which have been accepted, that is, to the past.\u00a0 \"Modification\" for the future cannot therefore be conjured up by oral testimony if the price involved is $500.00 or more since such modification must be shown at least by an authenticated memo.\u00a0 And since a memo is limited in its effect to the quantity of goods set forth in it there is safeguard against oral evidence.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) permits the parties in effect to make their own Statute of Frauds as regards any future modification of the contract by giving effect to a clause in a signed agreement which expressly requires any modification to be by signed writing.\u00a0 But note that if a consumer is to be held to such a clause on a form supplied by a merchant it must be separately signed.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsection (4) is intended, despite the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), to prevent contractual provisions excluding modification except by a signed writing from limiting in other respects the legal effect of the parties' actual later conduct.\u00a0 The effect of such conduct as a waiver is further regulated in subsection (5).\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 1-203.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 1-201, 1-203, 2-615 and 2-616.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 2-106, 2-201 and 2-202.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Sections 2-202 and 2-208.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Agreement\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Between merchants\".\u00a0 Section 2-104.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Notification\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Signed\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Term\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Writing\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
