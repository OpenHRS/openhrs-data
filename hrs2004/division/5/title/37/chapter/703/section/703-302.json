    "text": "(1)  Conduct which the actor believes to be necessary to avoid an imminent harm or evil to the actor or to another is justifiable provided that:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tThe harm or evil sought to be avoided by such conduct is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged; and\n\t(b)\tNeither the Code nor other law defining the offense provides exceptions or defenses dealing with the specific situation involved; and\n\t(c)\tA legislative purpose to exclude the justification claimed does not otherwise plainly appear.\n\n\n\n\t(2)  When the actor was reckless or negligent in bringing about the situation requiring a choice of harms or evils or in appraising the necessity for the actor's conduct, the justification afforded by this section is unavailable in a prosecution for any offense for which recklessness or negligence, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability.\n\t(3)  In a prosecution for escape under section 710-1020 or 710-1021, the defense available under this section is limited to an affirmative defense consisting of the following elements:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tThe actor receives a threat, express or implied, of death, substantial bodily injury, or forcible sexual attack;\n\t(b)\tComplaint to the proper prison authorities is either impossible under the circumstances or there exists a history of futile complaints;\n\t(c)\tUnder the circumstances there is no time or opportunity to resort to the courts;\n\t(d)\tNo force or violence is used against prison personnel or other innocent persons; and\n\t(e)\tThe actor promptly reports to the proper authorities when the actor has attained a position of safety from the immediate threat.
