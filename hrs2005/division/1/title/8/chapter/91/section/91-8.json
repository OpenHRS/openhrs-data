Any interested person may petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the agency.  Each agency shall adopt rules prescribing the form of the petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration, and prompt disposition.  Orders disposing of petitions in such cases shall have the same status as other agency orders. [L 1961, c 103, \u00a78; Supp, \u00a76C-8; HRS \u00a791-8]  Case Notes\n\n  Hawaii public employment relations board was empowered to make declaratory ruling regarding whether violation of collective bargaining agreement is a prohibited practice.  60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.\n  Where an agency employee\u0092s only interest in obtaining a declaratory ruling from that agency stems from his or her work as an agency employee, that interest is insufficient to satisfy this section\u0092s standing requirements; where executive director\u0092s interest in filing the petition stemmed from the director\u0092s work as executive director, the Hawaii civil rights commission did not have jurisdiction to issue a declaratory order on the petition.  104 H. 158, 86 P.3d 449."
