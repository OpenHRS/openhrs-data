[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-306; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) of this section, in regard to output and requirements, applies to this specific problem the general approach of this Act which requires the reading of commercial background and intent into the language of any agreement and demands good faith in the performance of that agreement.\u00a0 It applies to such contracts of nonproducing establishments such as dealers or distributors as well as to manufacturing concerns.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Under this Article, a contract for output or requirements is not too indefinite since it is held to mean the actual good faith output or requirements of the particular party.\u00a0 Nor does such a contract lack mutuality of obligation since, under this section, the party who will determine quantity is required to operate his plant or conduct his business in good faith and according to commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade so that his output or requirements will approximate a reasonably foreseeable figure.\u00a0 Reasonable elasticity in the requirements is expressly envisaged by this section and good faith variations from prior requirements are permitted even when the variation may be such as to result in discontinuance.\u00a0 A shut-down by a requirements buyer for lack of orders might be permissible when a shut-down merely to curtail losses would not.\u00a0 The essential test is whether the party is acting in good faith.\u00a0 Similarly, a sudden expansion of the plant by which requirements are to be measured would not be included within the scope of the contract as made but normal expansion undertaken in good faith would be within the scope of this section.\u00a0 One of the factors in an expansion situation would be whether the market price had risen greatly in a case in which the requirements contract contained a fixed price.\u00a0 Reasonable variation of an extreme sort is exemplified in Southwest Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma Portland Cement Co., 102 F.2d 630 (C.C.A. 10, 1939).\u00a0 This Article takes no position as to whether a requirements contract is a provable claim in bankruptcy.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 If an estimate of output or requirements is included in the agreement, no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to it may be tendered or demanded.\u00a0 Any minimum or maximum set by the agreement shows a clear limit on the intended elasticity.\u00a0 In similar fashion, the agreed estimate is to be regarded as a center around which the parties intend the variation to occur.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 When an enterprise is sold, the question may arise whether the buyer is bound by an existing output or requirements contract.\u00a0 That question is outside the scope of this Article, and is to be determined on other principles of law.\u00a0 Assuming that the contract continues, the output or requirements in the hands of the new owner continue to be measured by the actual good faith output or requirements under the normal operation of the enterprise prior to sale.\u00a0 The sale itself is not grounds for sudden expansion or decrease.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Subsection (2), on exclusive dealing, makes explicit the commercial rule embodied in this Act under which the parties to such contracts are held to have impliedly, even when not expressly, bound themselves to use reasonable diligence as well as good faith in their performance of the contract.\u00a0 Under such contracts the exclusive agent is required, although no express commitment has been made, to use reasonable effort and due diligence in the expansion of the market or the promotion of the product, as the case may be.\u00a0 The principal is expected under such a contract to refrain from supplying any other dealer or agent within the exclusive territory.\u00a0 An exclusive dealing agreement brings into play all of the good faith aspects of the output and requirement problems of subsection (1).\u00a0 It also raises questions of insecurity and right to adequate assurance under this Article.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Section 2-210.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Sections 1-203 and 2-609.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Agreement\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Term\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
