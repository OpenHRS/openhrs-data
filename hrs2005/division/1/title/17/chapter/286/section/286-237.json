    "text": "The examiners of drivers may issue a nonresident commercial driver's license to a resident of a foreign jurisdiction if the United States Secretary of Transportation has determined that the commercial motor vehicle testing and licensing standards in the foreign jurisdiction do not meet the testing standards established in 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 383.  The word \"nonresident\" must appear on the face of the nonresident commercial driver's license.  Prior to issuing a nonresident commercial driver's license, the examiner of drivers must establish the practical capability of revoking, suspending, and canceling the nonresident commercial driver's license and disqualifying that person with the same conditions applicable to the commercial driver's license issued to a resident of this State.
