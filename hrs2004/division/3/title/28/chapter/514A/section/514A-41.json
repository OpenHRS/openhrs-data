    "text": "(a)  If after the effective date has been issued by the commission for a public report, any circumstance occurs which would render the public report misleading as to purchasers in any material respect, the developer shall stop all offers of sale and sales and immediately submit to the commission a supplementary public report, together with such supporting information as may be required by the commission, to update the information contained in the public report, accompanied by a nonrefundable fee as provided in rules adopted by the director of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to chapter 91.  Offers of sale and sales shall not resume until an effective date has been issued by the commission for the supplementary public report.  The developer shall provide all prospective purchasers with a true copy of the supplementary public report and all prior public reports not superseded by the supplementary public report. \t(b)  The commission may determine when a supplementary public report will supersede the public reports previously issued for the project.\n\t(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the rescission rights, if any, of a purchaser shall be governed exclusively by sections 514A-62 and 514A-63.
