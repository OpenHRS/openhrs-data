    "text": "(a)  Every individual who renders professional services as an employee of a professional corporation shall be liable for any negligent or wrongful act or omission in which the individual personally participates to the same extent as if the individual rendered the services as a sole practitioner.  An employee of a professional corporation shall not be liable for the conduct of other employees unless the employee is at fault in appointing, supervising, or cooperating with the other employees.  \t(b)  Every corporation whose employees perform professional services within the scope of their employment or of their apparent authority to act for the corporation shall be liable to the same extent as its employees. \n\t(c)  Except as otherwise provided by statute, if any corporation is liable under subsection (b), every shareholder of that corporation shall be liable to the same extent as though the shareholder were a partner in a partnership and the services giving rise to liability had been rendered on behalf of the partnership, unless the corporation has provided security for professional responsibility as provided in this subsection and the liability is satisfied to the extent contemplated by the insurance or bond which effectuates the security. \n\tA professional corporation may provide security for professional responsibility by procuring insurance or a surety bond issued by an insurance company, or coverage under chapter 435E, or any combination thereof, as the corporation may elect.  The minimum amount of security and requirements as to the form and coverage provided by the insurance policy or surety bond may be established for each profession by the licensing authority for the profession, and the minimum amount may be set to vary with the number of shareholders, the type of practice, or other variables deemed appropriate by the licensing authority.
