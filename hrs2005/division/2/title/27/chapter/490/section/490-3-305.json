An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.\n\t(d)  In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection (a) that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy, and lack of legal capacity. [L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a71]\nCase Notes\n  Where genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether plaintiff was a holder in due course, including whether plaintiff took mortgagor's note \"for value\" and whether plaintiff took the note \"in good faith\" and \"without notice that the note was overdue\" or that mortgagor had \"a defense or claim in recoupment\", trial court erred in granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.  99 H. 173 (App.), 53 P.3d 312."
