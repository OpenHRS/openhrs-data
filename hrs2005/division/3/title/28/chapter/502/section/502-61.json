    "text": "INTERLINEATIONS, ERASURES, ETC.\n\n     Every notary public or the officer authorized to take acknowledgments to instruments, before taking any acknowledgment, shall first carefully inspect any instrument proposed to be acknowledged before the notary public or officer, and ascertain whether there are any interlineations, erasures, or changes in the instrument.  If there are any interlineations, erasures, or changes, the notary public or officer shall call the attention thereto of the person offering to acknowledge the instrument.  If they are approved, the acknowledging officer shall place the officer's initials in the margin of the instrument opposite each interlineation, erasure, or change.  The initialing by the officer taking the acknowledgment is prima facie evidence of the extent of the interlineations, erasures, or changes and of the fact that the same were made prior to acknowledgment of the instrument, but does not preclude proof to the contrary.
