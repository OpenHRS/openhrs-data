[L 1983, c 171, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 316, \u00a73; am L 1992, c 190, \u00a77]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Cited, where plaintiffs sought reimbursement of legal fees expended during proceedings initiated pursuant to the Hawaii Child Protective Act, prior to the initiation of any Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \u00a71400 et seq.) proceedings and argued that the federal court had jurisdiction to hear their claim for attorneys' fees under 20 U.S.C. \u00a71415(i)(3)(B);\u00a0 plaintiffs' complaint was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u00a0 374 F. Supp. 2d 886.\n\u00a0 In the context of Child Protective Act proceedings involving parents neither resident nor domiciled in Hawaii, personal jurisdiction may not be exercised over a parent pursuant to this section to terminate their parental rights unless due process requirements are satisfied.\u00a0 83 H. 367, 926 P.2d 1290.\n\u00a0 As claim that health department was legally obligated to pay for child's services at private residential treatment center arose under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and child did not pursue the remedies available under the federal act to establish health department's obligation to pay for the services, family court lacked jurisdiction to order the department to pay for the services.\u00a0 96 H. 272, 30 P.3d 878.\n\u00a0 The harm to the children and threatened harm to them within the State, along with father's related in-state conduct, were sufficient to support subject matter jurisdiction and the resulting order granting foster custody to the State.\u00a0 99 H. 522, 57 P.3d 447."
