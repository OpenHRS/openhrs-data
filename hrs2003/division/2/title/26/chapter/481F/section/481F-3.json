This requirement is not applicable to general written material or advertising which does not constitute an offer to effect a specific sale. \n\t(b)  If the seller who publishes or distributes a written instrument which solicits a direct sale of prints in, into, or from this State disclaims knowledge as to any informational detail required by section 481F-4, the seller shall so state specifically and categorically with regard to each such detail to the end that the purchaser is enabled to judge the degree of uniqueness or scarcity of the prints offered for sale. \n\t(c)  No print multiple shall be offered for sale or sold in, into, or from this State by any seller, at wholesale or retail, unless the seller furnishes the purchaser a written instrument which clearly and conspicuously discloses the informational detail required by section 481F-4 prior to receiving any payment from the purchaser. \n\t(d)  If the seller of print multiples disclaims knowledge as to any informational detail required by section 481F-4, the seller shall so state specifically and categorically with regard to each such detail to the end that the purchaser is enabled to judge the degree of uniqueness or scarcity of the prints. \n\t(e)  A seller of print multiples may sell or offer to sell prints described in section 481F-2 without furnishing the informational details required by section 481F-4, unless the prints purport to be signed, numbered, approved by the artist, or to comprise a limited edition, in which case all of the informational details required by section 481F-4 shall be furnished.
