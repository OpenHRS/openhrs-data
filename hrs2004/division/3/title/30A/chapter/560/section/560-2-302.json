In abating the devises of the then-living children, the court shall preserve to the maximum extent possible the character of the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(b)  Neither subsection (a)(1) nor subsection (a)(2) applies if:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIt appears from the will that the omission was intentional; or\n\t(2)\tThe testator provided for the omitted after-born or after-adopted child by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or is reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in the testator's will for a living child solely because the testator believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted after-born or after-adopted child.\n\t(d)  In satisfying a share provided by subsection (a)(1), devises made by the will abate under section 560:3-902.
