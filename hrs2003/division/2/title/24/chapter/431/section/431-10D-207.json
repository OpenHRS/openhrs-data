    "text": "\u00a7431:10D-207    The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to an association of public employees, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of the association for the benefit of persons other than the association or any of its officials, subject to the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe association must have been formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance and have when the policy is placed in force, a membership in the classes eligible for insurance of not less than seventy-five per cent of the number of employees eligible for membership in such classes.\n\t(2)\tThe members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the association, or all of any class or classes thereof.\n\t(3)\tThe premium for the policy shall be paid either from the association's own funds or from charges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, or from both.  Any charges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, and the dues of the association if they include the cost of insurance, may be collected through deductions by the employer from the salaries of the members.  The deductions from salary may be paid by the employer to the association or directly to the insurer.  No policy may be placed in force unless and until at least seventy-five per cent of the then eligible members of the association, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, have elected to be covered and have authorized their employer to make the required deductions from salary, or have otherwise assigned pay or arranged for payment of their individual contributions to the association.  Except as provided in item (4), a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members, except those who reject such coverage in writing.\n\t(4)\tAn insurer may exclude or limit the coverage on any person as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.\n\t(5)\tCharges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, and the dues of the association if they include the cost of insurance, may be determined according to each attained age or in not less than four reasonably spaced attained age groups.  This provision, however, shall not preclude an average rate for the whole group with charges to the individual members based on a schedule of insurance graded by rank, salary bracket, or by length of service or seniority.\n\t(6)\tThe policy must cover at least twenty-five persons at date of issue.\n\t(7)\tThe amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the association.\n\t(8)\tAs used herein, public employees means employees of the United States government, or of any state, or of any political subdivision or instrumentality or department or bureau or board or commission of any of them, or the national guard as an association in nature under its existing form.
