If access to an individual condominium unit is necessary, and the association is unable to obtain such access, then the association shall have a reasonable time to provide access.  If destructive testing is required, the contractor shall give advance notice of tests and return the premises to its pre-testing condition.  If inspection or testing reveals a condition that requires additional testing to fully and completely evaluate the nature, cause, and extent of the construction defect, the contractor shall provide notice to the claimant of the need for additional testing.  Claimant shall provide additional access to the premises.  If a claim is asserted on behalf of owners of multiple dwellings, or multiple owners of units within a multi-family complex, the contractor shall be entitled to inspect each of the dwellings or units.\n\t(d)  Within fourteen days following the inspection and testing, the contractor shall serve on the claimant a written:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tOffer to fully or partially remedy the construction defect at no cost to the claimant.  Such offer shall include a description of construction necessary to remedy the construction defect and a timetable for the completion of the additional construction;\n\t(2)\tOffer to settle the claim by monetary payment;\n\t(3)\tOffer for a combination of repairs and monetary payment; or\n\t(4)\tStatement that the contractor will not proceed further to remedy the construction defect.\n\n\n\nAny offer of settlement under this section shall reference this section, and shall state that a claimant's failure to respond with a written notice of acceptance or rejection within thirty or forty-five days, whichever applies pursuant to section 672E-5(a), shall mean that the offer is rejected.  Failure to serve a written offer or statement under this section shall be deemed a statement that the contractor will not proceed further. [L 2004, c 119, pt of \u00a72]"
