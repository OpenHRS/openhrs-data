[L 1980, c 294, \u00a71; am L 1994, c 229, \u00a73]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 294, Session Laws 1980, enacted this section to provide for automatic sentence of imprisonment for any person convicted of a class A felony.\u00a0 The Legislature stated:\u00a0 \"Your Committee feels that the seriousness of class A felonies...merits mandatory imprisonment.\u00a0 This bill effects this purpose by denying suspension of sentence and probation as sentencing options in class A convictions, but retains, through indeterminate sentence, the option of parole by the paroling authority in order that unusual extenuating circumstances can be given due consideration.\"\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 965-80.\n\u00a0 Act 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section, inter alia, to allow the court to make an exception for a person convicted of a class A felony defined in chapter 712, part IV, from the mandatory sentence of an indeterminate term of imprisonment without the possibility of suspension of sentence or probation.\u00a0 The legislature believed that, in certain instances, the public is better served by allowing judges some discretion in evaluating all appropriate sentencing and treatment alternatives available for drug offenders.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Protection of Individual Rights Under Hawai`i's Constitution.\u00a0 14 UH L. Rev. 311.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Reasonable inference could be drawn that sentencing court considered special eight-year term under \u00a7706-667 prior to sentencing young adult defendant to twenty-year term.\u00a0 73 H. 259, 831 P.2d 523.\n\u00a0 Although \"drug use\" is not a prerequisite to eligibility for probation under this section, the legislature contemplated, consistent with the factors enumerated in \u00a7706-621, that the trial court would grant probation in cases where strong mitigating circumstances favored it.\u00a0 97 H. 440, 39 P.3d 567.\n\u00a0\nHawaii Legal Reporter Citations\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Constitutional provisions not violated.\u00a0 81-1 HLR 810157."
