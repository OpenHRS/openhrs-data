    "text": "A person may be committed to a psychiatric facility for involuntary hospitalization, if the court finds:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThat the person is mentally ill or suffering from substance abuse;\n\t(2)\tThat the person is imminently dangerous to self or others, is gravely disabled or is obviously ill; and\n\t(3)\tThat the person is in need of care or treatment, or both, and there is no suitable alternative available through existing facilities and programs which would be less restrictive than hospitalization. [L 1984, c 188, pt of \u00a73; am L 1985, c 75, \u00a72; am L 1986, c 335, \u00a74]\n\n\n\n\nCross References\n  Intermediate sanctions for selected offenders and defendants, see \u00a7\u00a7353-10.5, 353-63.5, and 706-605.1.\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n  Risky Business:  Assessing Dangerousness in Hawai`i.  24 UH L. Rev. 63.\nCase Notes\n  In light of the definition of \"dangerous to self\" under \u00a7334-1, person's refusal to take medications and person's racist remarks to strangers constituted insufficient evidence to support family court's finding that person was imminently and substantially dangerous to person's self.  102 H. 528 (App.), 78 P.3d 341."
