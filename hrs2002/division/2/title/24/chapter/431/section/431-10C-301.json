An insurer may offer the underinsured motorist coverage required by this paragraph in the same manner as uninsured motorist coverage; provided that the offer of both shall:\n\n\t\t(A)\tBe conspicuously displayed so as to be readily noticeable by the insured;\n\t\t(B)\tSet forth the premium for the coverage adjacent to the offer in a manner that the premium is clearly identifiable with the offer and may be easily subtracted from the total premium to determine the premium payment due in the event the insured elects not to purchase the option; and\n\t\t(C)\tProvide for written rejection of the coverage by requiring the insured to affix the insured's signature in a location adjacent to or directly below the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The stacking or aggregating of uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage is prohibited, except as provided in subsection (d).\n\t(d)  An insurer shall offer the insured the opportunity to purchase uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage by offering the following options with each motor vehicle insurance policy:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe option to stack uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage; and\n\t(2)\tThe option to select uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage, whichever is applicable, up to but not greater than the bodily injury liability coverage limits in the insured's policy.\n\n\n\n\tThese offers are to be made when a motor vehicle insurance policy is first applied for or issued.  For any existing policies, an insurer shall offer such coverage at the first renewal after January 1, 1993.  Once an insured has been provided the opportunity to purchase or reject the coverages in writing under the options, no further offer is required to be included with any renewal or replacement policy issued to the insured.\n\t(e)  If uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage is rejected, pursuant to section 431:10C-301(b):\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe offers required by section 431:10C-301(d) are not required to be made;\n\t(2)\tNo further offers or notice of the availability of uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage are required to be made in connection with any renewal or replacement policy; and\n\t(3)\tThe written rejections required by section 431:10C-301(b) shall be presumptive evidence of the insured's decision to reject the options.
