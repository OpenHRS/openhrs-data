[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-515; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 To meet certain serious problems which arise when there is a dispute as to the quality of the goods and thereby perhaps to aid the parties in reaching a settlement, and to further the use of devices which will promote certainty as to the condition of the goods, or at least aid in preserving evidence of their condition.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Under paragraph (a), to afford either party an opportunity for preserving evidence, whether or not agreement has been reached, and thereby to reduce uncertainty in any litigation and, in turn perhaps, to promote agreement.\n\u00a0 Paragraph (a) does not conflict with the provisions on the seller's right to resell rejected goods or the buyer's similar right.\u00a0 Apparent conflict between these provisions which will be suggested in certain circumstances is to be resolved by requiring prompt action by the parties.\u00a0 Nor does paragraph (a) impair the effect of a term for payment before inspection.\u00a0 Short of such defects as amount to fraud or substantial failure of consideration, non-conformity is neither an excuse nor a defense to an action for non-acceptance of documents.\u00a0 Normally, therefore, until the buyer has made payment, inspected and rejected the goods, there is no occasion or use for the rights under paragraph (a).\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Under paragraph (b), to provide for third party inspection upon the agreement of the parties, thereby opening the door to amicable adjustments based upon the findings of such third parties.\n\u00a0 The use of the phrase \"conformity or condition\" makes it clear that the parties' agreement may range from a complete settlement of all aspects of the dispute by a third party to the use of a third party merely to determine and record the condition of the goods so that they can be resold or used to reduce the stake in controversy.\u00a0 \"Conformity\", at one end of the scale of possible issues, includes the whole question of interpretation of the agreement and its legal effect, the state of the goods in regard to quality and condition, whether any defects are due to factors which operate at the risk of the buyer, and the degree of non- conformity where that may be material.\u00a0 \"Condition\", at the other end of the scale, includes nothing but the degree of damage or deterioration which the goods show.\u00a0 Paragraph (b) is intended to reach any point in the gamut which the parties may agree upon.\n\u00a0 The principle of the section on reservation of rights reinforces this paragraph in simplifying such adjustments as the parties wish to make in partial settlement while reserving their rights as to any further points.\u00a0 Paragraph (b) also suggests the use of arbitration, where desired, of any points left open, but nothing in this section is intended to repeal or amend any statute governing arbitration.\u00a0 Where any question arises as to the extent of the parties' agreement under the paragraph, the presumption should be that it was meant to extend only to the relation between the contract description and the goods as delivered, since that is what a craftsman in the trade would normally be expected to report upon.\u00a0 Finally, a written and authenticated report of inspection or tests by a third party, whether or not sampling has been practicable, is entitled to be admitted as evidence under this Act, for it is a third party document.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 2-513(3), 2-706 and 2-711(2) and Article 5.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 1-202 and 1-207.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notification\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
