the highest degree, presenting the most serious aggravations, is made a class B felony, a more severe sanction than that provided by prior law.\u00a0 The least serious case, promotion in the third degree, is a misdemeanor, the same sanction provided for what was previously termed \"soliciting.\"\u00a0 The best that can be said for the former statutes in this area is that they were inartfully drawn.\u00a0 They probably bordered on vagueness which may have been unconstitutional.\u00a0 The Code achieves greater clarity than the previous law and provides for sanctions which are more realistically addressed to the circumstances involved in the offenses.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1201 TO 712-1204\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 130, Session Laws 1993, amended \u00a7712-1202 to raise, from fourteen to sixteen, the age of exploited minors that would subject a perpetrator to a first degree charge for the offense of promoting prostitution.\u00a0 The Act also amended \u00a7\u00a7712-1202 and 712-1203 to make the language in these sections gender neutral.\u00a0 The legislature found that there was a need to enlarge the scope of persons subject to increased criminal penalties for promoting teen-age prostitution.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\u00a0 Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended \u00a7712-1202 by adding a reference to \"force, threat, or intimidation\" and deleting \"criminal coercion.\"\u00a0 Act 147 also applied the offense to a person who knowingly advances or profits from prostitution of a person less than eighteen, rather than sixteen, years old.\u00a0 The legislature strengthened the laws on prostitution and related offenses to deter and punish sexual exploitation of minors, including obscenity-related activities.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\u00a0 Act 147, Session Laws 2008, amended \u00a7712-1203(1) by adding a reference to \"prostituted persons.\"\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 38-08.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 2011, amended \u00a7712-1201 by making conforming and nonsubstantive amendments.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 2011, amended \u00a7712-1202 by adding inducing a person to act by specified means and including the use of fraud as elements of promoting prostitution in the first degree.\u00a0 Act 145 also increased the penalty for the offense to a class A felony. \u00a0Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\u00a0 Act 145, Session Laws 2011, repealed , promoting prostitution in the third degree, and amended \u00a7712-1203, promoting prostitution in the second degree, by incorporating conduct previously prohibited under  within the second degree offense.\u00a0 Act 145 increased the penalty for the second degree offense to a class B felony.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1137, Conference Committee Report No. 76.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7712-1201 To 712-1204 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7768-56.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id. \u00a7\u00a7768-53, 768-54."
