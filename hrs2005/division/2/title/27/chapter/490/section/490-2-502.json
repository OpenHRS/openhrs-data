[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-502; HRS \u00a7490:2-502; am L 2000, c 241, \u00a714]\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n  Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  Compare Sections 17, 18 and 19, Uniform Sales Act.\n Purposes:\n  1.  This section gives an additional right to the buyer as a result of identification of the goods to the contract in the manner provided in Section 2-501.  The buyer is given a right to the goods on the seller's insolvency occurring within 10 days after he receives the first installment on their price.\n  2.  The question of whether the buyer also acquires a security interest in identified goods and has rights to the goods when insolvency takes place after the ten-day period provided in this section depends upon compliance with the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9).\n  3.  Subsection (2) is included to preclude the possibility of unjust enrichment which exists if the buyer were permitted to recover goods even though they were greatly superior in quality or quantity to that called for by the contract for sale.\n  Cross References:\n  Point 1:  Sections 1-201 and 2-702.\n  Point 2:  Article 9.\n Definitional Cross References:\n  \"Buyer\".
