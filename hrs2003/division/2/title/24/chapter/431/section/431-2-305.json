Upon receipt of the verified report, the insurance division shall transmit the report to the insurer or person examined, together with a notice that shall afford the insurer or person examined a reasonable opportunity for not more than thirty days to make a written submission or rebuttal with respect to any matters contained in the examination report.\n\t(c)  Within thirty days of the end of the period allowed for the receipt of written submissions or rebuttals, the commissioner shall fully consider and review the report, together with any written submissions or rebuttals and any relevant portions of the examiner's workpapers and enter an order to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAdopt the examination report as filed, or with modifications or corrections.

Thereafter, the commissioner may open the report for public inspection so long as no court of competent jurisdiction has stayed its publication; and\n\t(2)\tNothing contained in the insurance code shall prevent or be construed as prohibiting the commissioner from disclosing the content of an examination report, preliminary examination report or results, or any matter relating thereto, to the regulatory agency for insurance of any state or country, or to law enforcement officials of this or any other state or agency of the federal government at any time, so long as such agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees in writing to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this part.\n\n\n\n\t(f)  All working papers, recorded information, documents, and copies thereof produced by, obtained by, or disclosed to the commissioner or any other person in the course of an examination, shall be confidential and not subject to subpoena and shall not be made public by the commissioner or any other person, except to the extent provided in subsection (e).
