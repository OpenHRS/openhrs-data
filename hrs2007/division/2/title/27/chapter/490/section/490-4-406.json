Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This section is new to Uniform Laws.\u00a0 It is to replace statutes in forty jurisdictions dealing with the general subject of a depositor's duty to discover and report forgeries and alterations.\u00a0 In these statutes there is substantial variation in rules prescribed as to the following matters:\u00a0 application of the statute to unauthorized signatures, raised checks or altered checks; inclusion of special provisions with respect to fictitious payees; periods of time prescribed for termination of right of customer to assert claims against bank; time when limitation period begins to run; restriction of rights of customer stated in terms of liability for loss, preclusion of rights or limitations on time in which suits may be brought.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (1) states the general duty of a customer to exercise reasonable care and promptness to examine his bank statements and items to discover his unauthorized signature or any alteration and to promptly notify the bank if he discovers an unauthorized signature or alteration.\u00a0 This duty becomes operative when the bank does any one of three things with respect to the statement of account and supporting items paid in good faith.\u00a0 The first action is the sending of the statement and items to the customer.\u00a0 The sending may be either by mailing or any other action within the definition of \"send\" (Section 1-201).\u00a0 The second action is the holding of such statement and items available for the customer pursuant to a request for instructions of the customer.\u00a0 The third action is stated as \"or otherwise in a reasonable manner makes the statement and items available to the customer.\"\u00a0 Such wider residual language is desirable to cover unusual situations.\u00a0 An example might be where the bank knows a customer has left a former address but does not know any new address to which to send the statement or item or to obtain instructions from the customer.\u00a0 The third residual type of action, however, must be \"reasonable\" and any court has the power to determine that a particular action or practice of a bank, other than sending statements and items or holding them pursuant to instructions, is not reasonable.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (2) states the effect of a failure of a customer to comply with subsection (1).\u00a0 The first effect stated in subparagraph (a) is that he is precluded from asserting against the bank his unauthorized signature and alteration if the bank establishes that it suffered a loss by reason of the customer's failure.\u00a0 The bank has the burden of establishing that it suffered some loss.\n\u00a0 Under subparagraph (b) if, after the first item and statement becomes available plus a reasonable period not exceeding fourteen calendar days, the bank pays in good faith any other item on which there is an unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer, which payment is prior to receipt by the bank of notification of such unauthorized signature or alteration on the first item, the customer is precluded from asserting the additional unauthorized signature or alteration.\u00a0 This rule follows substantial case law that payment of an additional item or items bearing an unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer is a loss suffered by the bank traceable to the customer's failure to exercise reasonable care in examining his statement and notifying the bank of objections to it.\u00a0 One of the most serious consequences of failure of the customer to comply with the requirements of subsection (1) is the opportunity presented to the wrongdoer to repeat his misdeeds.\u00a0 Conversely, one of the best ways to keep down losses in this type of situation is for the customer to promptly examine his statement and notify the bank of an unauthorized signature or alteration so that the bank will be alerted to stop paying further items.\u00a0 Hence, the rule of subparagraph (b) is prescribed and to avoid dispute a specific time limit for action by the customer is designated, namely fourteen calendar days.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The two effects on the customer of his failure to comply with subsection (1) (subparagraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2)) are stated in terms of preclusion from asserting a claim against the bank.\u00a0 However, these two effects occur only if the customer has failed to exercise reasonable care and promptness in examining his statement and items and notifying the bank and as to this question of fact the burden is upon the bank to establish such failure.\u00a0 Further, even if the bank succeeds in establishing that the customer has failed to exercise ordinary care, if in turn the customer succeeds in establishing that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item(s) the preclusion rule does not apply.\u00a0 This distribution of the burden of establishing between the customer and the bank provides reasonable equality of treatment and requires each person asserting the negligence to establish such negligence rather than requiring either person to establish that his entire course of conduct constituted ordinary care.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Whether the preclusion rule of subsection (2) operates or does not operate depends upon determinations as to ordinary care of the customer and possibly of the bank.\u00a0 However, subsection (4) places an absolute time limit on the right of a customer to make claim for payment of altered or forged paper without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank.\u00a0 In the case of alteration or the unauthorized signature of the customer himself the absolute time limit is one year.\u00a0 In the case of unauthorized indorsements it is three years.\u00a0 This recognizes that there is little excuse for a customer not detecting an alteration of his own check or a forgery of his own signature.\u00a0 However, he does not know the signatures of indorsers and may be delayed in learning that indorsements are forged.\u00a0 The three year absolute time limit on the discovery of forged indorsements should be ample, because in the great preponderance of cases the customer will learn of the forged indorsements within this time and if in any exceptional case he does not, the balance in favor of a mechanical termination of the liability of the bank outweighs what few residuary risks the customer may still have.\u00a0 In thirteen of the existing statutes there are limitations on the liability of a bank for payment of items bearing forged indorsements which limitation periods range from thirty days to two years.\u00a0 In the remaining twenty-seven no provision is made for forged indorsements.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Nothing in this section is intended to affect any decision holding that a customer who has notice of something wrong with an indorsement must exercise reasonable care to investigate and to notify the bank.\u00a0 It should be noted that under the rules relating to impostors and signatures in the name of the payee (Section 3-405) certain forged indorsements on which the bank has paid the item in good faith may be treated as effective notwithstanding such discovery and notice.\u00a0 If the alteration or forgery results from the drawer's negligence the drawee who pays in good faith is also protected.\u00a0 Section 3-406.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 The forty existing statutes on the subject as well as Section 4-406 evidence a public policy in favor of imposing on customers the duty of prompt examination of their bank statements and the notification of banks of forgeries and alterations and in favor of reasonable time limitations on the responsibility of banks for payment of forged or altered items.\u00a0 In two New York cases, however, it has been held that a payor bank may waive defenses of the kind prescribed by the section and ignore the public policy indicated by these defenses and recover the full amount of a forged or altered item from a collecting bank.\u00a0 Fallick v. Amalgamated Bank of New York, 232 App. Div. 127, 249 N.Y.S. 238 (1st Dep't. 1931); National Surety Corp. v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 188 Misc. 207, 70 N.Y.S.2d 636 (1946), affirmed without opinion 188 Misc. 213, 70 N.Y.S.2d 642 (1946).\u00a0 Subsection (5) is intended to reject the holding of these and like cases.\u00a0 Although the principle of subsection (5) might well be applied to other types of claims of customers against banks and defenses to these claims, the rule of the subsection is limited to defenses of a payor bank under this section.\u00a0 No present need is known to give the rule wider effect.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-404, 3-405, 3-406, 3-407, 3-417 and 4-207.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Alteration\".\u00a0 Section 3-407.\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Indorsement\".\u00a0 Section 3-204.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Send\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Unauthorized signature\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
