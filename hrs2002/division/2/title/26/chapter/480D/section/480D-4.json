Examples of bona fide error include, but are not limited to, clerical miscalculations, computer malfunction, printing errors, and computer programming errors.  If bona fide error is proven, the debt collector shall: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tCorrect the error as expeditiously as possible and make every reasonable effort to correct any consequences of that error; and \n\t(2)\tBe liable for any actual damages suffered by the consumer including the time and expense required to correct the error. \n\n\n\nA court may award reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the consumer in insuring that the error and its consequences are corrected.
