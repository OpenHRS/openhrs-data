At a minimum, the budget shall include the following:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe estimated revenues and operating expenses of the association;\n\t(2)\tInformation as to whether the budget has been prepared on a cash or accrual basis;\n\t(3)\tThe total replacement reserves of the association as of the date of the budget;\n\t(4)\tThe estimated replacement reserves the association will require to maintain the property based on a reserve study performed by the association;\n\t(5)\tA general explanation of how the estimated replacement reserves are computed;\n\t(6)\tThe amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund the estimated replacement reserves; and\n\t(7)\tInformation as to whether the amount the association must collect for the fiscal year to fund the estimated replacement reserves was calculated using a per cent funded or cash flow plan.  The method or plan shall not circumvent the estimated replacement reserves amount determined by the reserve study pursuant to paragraph (4).\n\n\n\n\t(b)  The association shall assess the apartment owners to either fund a minimum of fifty per cent of the estimated replacement reserves or fund one hundred per cent of the estimated replacement reserves when using a cash flow plan; provided that a new association created after January 1, 1993, need not collect estimated replacement reserves until the fiscal year which begins after the association's first annual meeting.  For each fiscal year, the association shall collect the amount assessed to fund the estimated replacement for that fiscal year reserves, as determined by the association's plan, except:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe commission shall adopt rules to permit an existing association to fund its estimated replacement reserves in increments after January 1, 1993 and prior to January 1, 2000; and\n\t(2)\tThe commission shall adopt rules to permit an association to fund in increments, over three years, estimated replacement reserves that have been substantially depleted by an emergency.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The association shall compute the estimated replacement reserves by a formula which is based on the estimated life and the estimated capital expenditure or major maintenance required for each part of the property.  The estimated replacement reserves shall include:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAdjustments for revenues which will be received and expenditures which will be made before the beginning of the fiscal year to which the budget relates; and\n\t(2)\tSeparate, designated reserves for each part of the property for which capital expenditures or major maintenance will exceed $10,000.  Parts of the property for which capital expenditures or major maintenance will not exceed $10,000 may be aggregated in a single designated reserve.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  No association or apartment owner, director, officer, managing agent, or employee of an association who makes a good faith effort to calculate the estimated replacement reserves for an association shall be liable if the estimate subsequently proves incorrect.\n\t(e)  The commission may request a copy of the annual operating budget of the association of apartment owners as part of the association's registration with the commission under section 514A-95.1.\n\t(f)  A board may not exceed its total adopted annual operating budget by more than twenty per cent during the fiscal year to which the budget relates, except in emergency situations.  Prior to the imposition or collection of an assessment under this paragraph, the board shall pass a resolution containing written findings as to the necessity of the extraordinary expense involved and why the expense was not or could not have been reasonably foreseen in the budgeting process, and the resolution shall be distributed to the members with the notice of assessment.\n\t(g)  The requirements of this section shall override any requirements in an association's declaration, bylaws, or any other association documents relating to preparation of budgets, calculation of reserve requirements, assessment and funding of reserves, with the exception of:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAny provisions relating to the repair and maintenance of property;\n\t(2)\tAny requirements in an association's declaration, bylaws, or any other association documents which require the association to collect more than fifty per cent of reserve requirements; or\n\t(3)\tAny provisions relating to upgrading the common elements, such as additions, improvements, and alterations to the common elements.\n\n\n\n\t(h)  Subject to the procedures of section 514A-94 and any rules adopted by the commission, any apartment owner whose association board fails to comply with this section may enforce compliance by the board.  In any proceeding to enforce compliance, a board which has not prepared an annual operating budget and reserve study shall have the burden of proving it has complied with this section.\n\t(i)  The commission may adopt rules to implement this section.\n\t(j)  As used in this section:\n\t\"Capital expenditure\" means an expense that results from the purchase or replacement of an asset whose life is greater than one year, or the addition of an asset that extends the life of an existing asset for a period greater than one year.\n\t\"Cash flow plan\" means a minimum twenty-year projection of an association's future income and expense requirements to fund fully its replacement reserves requirements each year during that twenty-year period, except in an emergency; provided that it does not include a projection of special assessments or loans during that twenty-year period, except in an emergency.\n\t\"Emergency situation\" means any extraordinary expenses:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tRequired by an order of a court;\n\t(2)\tNecessary to repair or maintain any part of the property for which the association is responsible where a threat to personal safety on the property is discovered;\n\t(3)\tNecessary to repair any part of the property for which the association is responsible that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board in preparing and distributing the annual operating budget; or\n\t(4)\tNecessary to respond to any legal or administrative proceeding brought against the association that could not have been reasonably foreseen by the board in preparing and distributing the annual operating budget.\n\t(5)\tNecessary for the association to obtain adequate insurance for the property which the association must insure.\n\n\n\n\t\"Major maintenance\" means an expenditure for maintenance or repair that will result in extending the life of an asset for a period greater than one year.\n\t\"Replacement reserves\" means funds for the upkeep, repair, or replacement of those parts of the property, including, but not limited to roofs, walls, decks, paving, and equipment, that the association is obligated to maintain.
