The commissioner may limit the amount of each type of asset that may be deposited.  An asset will not satisfy the requirements of this section if it is an instrument that is issued by the foreign bank itself, or by a person who controls, is controlled by, or is in common control with the foreign bank.\n\t(c)  The commissioner, from time to time, may require that the assets deposited pursuant to this section may be maintained by the foreign bank in an amount, in a form, and subject to any conditions, the commissioner deems necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors and the public interest, and to maintain public confidence in the business of the Hawaii state branch or Hawaii state agency.  The commissioner may give credit to reserves required to be maintained with a Federal Reserve Bank in or outside this State pursuant to federal law, in accordance with rules or procedures as the commissioner may adopt.\n\t(d)  So long as it shall continue business in the ordinary course, the foreign bank shall be permitted to collect interest on the securities deposited under this section and from time to time exchange, examine and compare the securities.
