    "text": "If any mineral is discovered or known to exist on reserved lands, any interested person may notify the board of land and natural resources of the person's desire to apply for a mining lease.\u00a0 The notice shall be accompanied by a fee of $100 together with a description of the land desired to be leased and the minerals involved and such information and maps as the board may by regulation prescribe.\u00a0 The board may grant a mining lease on reserved lands in accordance with section 182-4, or the board may, by the vote of two-thirds of its members to which the board is entitled, without public auction, grant a mining lease on reserved lands to the occupier thereof.\u00a0 Such a mining lease may be granted to a person other than the occupier if the occupier has assigned the occupier's rights to apply for a mining lease to another person, in which case only such an assignee may be granted a mining lease.\u00a0 Any provisions to the contrary notwithstanding, if the board decides that it is appropriate to grant a geothermal mining lease on the reserved lands, the surface owner or the owner's assignee shall have the first right of refusal for a mining lease; however, the granting of a geothermal mining lease does not create the presumption that a geothermal resource subzone will be designated, nor shall geothermal development activities occur on land within the geothermal mining lease until the area is designated a geothermal resource subzone.\u00a0 If the occupier or the occupier's assignee of the right to obtain a mining lease should fail to apply for a mining lease within six months from the date of notice from the board of a finding by the board that it is in the public interest that the minerals on the reserved lands be mined, a mining lease shall be granted under section 182-4; provided that bidders at the public auction shall bid on an amount to be paid to the State for a mining lease granting to the lessee the right to exploit minerals reserved to the State.
