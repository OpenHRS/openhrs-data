    "text": "(a)  The owner of a mark which is famous in this State shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as a court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use of a mark or trade name, if the use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the famous mark, and to obtain such other relief as provided in this part.  In determining whether a mark is distinctive and famous, a court may consider but shall not be limited to factors such as:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark in this State;\n\t(2)\tThe duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods and services with which the mark is used;\n\t(3)\tThe duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark in this State;\n\t(4)\tThe geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used;\n\t(5)\tThe channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used;\n\t(6)\tThe degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade in this State used by the owner of the mark and the person against whom the injunction is sought;\n\t(7)\tThe nature and extent of the use of the same or a similar mark by third parties; and\n\t(8)\tWhether the mark is registered in this State, or federally under the Act of March 3, 1881, or under the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  In any action brought under this section, the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled only to injunctive relief in this State, unless the person against whom the injunctive relief is sought wilfully intended to trade on the owner's reputation or to cause dilution of the famous mark.  If wilful intent is proven, the owner shall also be entitled to the remedies set forth in this chapter, subject to the discretion of the court and the principles of equity.\n\t(c)  The fair use of a famous mark by another person in comparative commercial advertising or promotion to identify the competing goods or services of the owner of the famous mark, the noncommercial use of the mark, and all forms of news reporting and news commentary shall not be actionable under this section.
