A member may authorize another person to act as a proxy for the member by:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tExecuting a writing authorizing another person or persons to act as a proxy for the member, which may be accomplished by the member or the member's authorized attorney-in-fact, officer, director, employee, or agent signing the writing or causing the member's signature to be affixed to the writing by any reasonable means, including without limitation the use of a facsimile signature; or\n\t(2)\tTransmitting or authorizing the transmission of a telegram, cablegram, facsimile, or other means of electronic transmission authorizing the person or persons to act as a proxy for the member to the person or persons who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization, or similar agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive the transmission; provided that any such transmission shall specify that the transmission was authorized by the member.  A copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to the foregoing may be used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that any such copy, facsimile telecommunication, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  An appointment of a proxy is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes.  An appointment is valid for eleven months unless a different period is expressly provided in the appointment form; provided that no proxy shall be valid for more than three years from its date of execution, unless otherwise specifically provided in the corporation's bylaws.\n\t(c)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member.\n\t(d)  The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises authority under the appointment.\n\t(e)  An appointment of a proxy is revocable by the member unless the appointment form conspicuously states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest.  Appointments coupled with an interest without limitation include the appointment of:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tA pledgee;\n\t(2)\tA creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms requiring the appointment;\n\t(3)\tAn employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or\n\t(4)\tA party to a voting agreement created under section 414D-117.\n\n\n\n\t(f)  Subject to section 414D-116 and any express limitation on the proxy's authority appearing on the face of the appointment form, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the member making the appointment.
