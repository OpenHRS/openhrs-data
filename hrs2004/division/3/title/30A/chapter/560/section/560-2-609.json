(a)  Property a testator gave in the testator's lifetime to a person is treated as a satisfaction of a devise in whole or in part, only if:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe will provides for deduction of the gift;\n\t(2)\tThe testator declared in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise; or\n\t(3)\tThe devisee acknowledged in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  For purposes of partial satisfaction, property given during lifetime is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or at the testator's death, whichever occurs first.\n\t(c)  If the devisee fails to survive the testator, the gift is treated as a full or partial satisfaction of the devise, as appropriate, in applying sections 560:2-603 and 560:2-604, unless the testator's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.
