L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74.\n \u00a7490:4-211    For purposes of determining its status as a holder in due course, a bank has given value to the extent it has a security interest in an item, if the bank otherwise complies with the requirements of section 490:3-302 on what constitutes a holder in due course. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-209; HRS \u00a7490:4-209; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  Negotiable Instruments Law, Section 27.\n  Purposes:\n  The section completes the thought of the previous section and makes clear that a security interest in an item is \"value\" for the purpose of determining the holder's status as a holder in due course.  The provision is in accord with the prior law (N.I.L. Section 27) and with Article 3 (Section 3-303).  The section does not prescribe a security interest under Section 4-208 as a test of \"value\" generally because the meaning of \"value\" under other Articles is adequately defined in Section 1-201.\n Cross References:\n  Sections 1-201, 3-302, 3-303 and 4-208.\n Definitional Cross References:\n  \"Bank\".  Section 1-201.\n  \"Holder in due course\".  Section 3-302.\n  \"Item\".  Section 4-104.\n  \"Security interest\".  Section 1-201."
