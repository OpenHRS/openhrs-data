    "text": "(a)  Any certificate of authority issued under this chapter may be suspended or revoked, and any application for a certificate of authority may be denied, if the commissioner finds that any of the conditions listed below exist:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe health maintenance organization is operating significantly in contravention of its basic organizational document or in a manner contrary to that described in any other information submitted under section 432D-2, unless amendments to such submissions have been filed with and approved by the commissioner;\n\t(2)\tThe health maintenance organization does not provide or arrange for basic health care services;\n\t(3)\tThe health maintenance organization is no longer financially responsible and may reasonably be expected to be unable to meet its obligations to enrollees or prospective enrollees;\n\t(4)\tThe health maintenance organization has failed to correct, within the time prescribed by subsection (c), any deficiency occurring due to the health maintenance organization's prescribed minimum net worth being impaired;\n\t(5)\tThe health maintenance organization, or any person on its behalf, has advertised or merchandised its services in an untrue, misrepresentative, misleading, deceptive, or unfair manner;\n\t(6)\tThe continued operation of the health maintenance organization would be hazardous to its enrollees; or\n\t(7)\tThe health maintenance organization has otherwise failed substantially to comply with this chapter.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  In addition to, or in lieu of, suspension or revocation of a certificate of authority pursuant to this section, the commissioner, after hearing, may levy an administrative fine upon the health maintenance organization in an amount not less than $500 and not more than $50,000 pursuant to section 431:3-221.\n\t(c)  The following shall pertain when insufficient net worth is maintained:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWhenever the commissioner finds that the net worth maintained by any health maintenance organization subject to this chapter is less than the minimum net worth required, the commissioner shall give written notice to the health maintenance organization of the amount of the deficiency and require the health maintenance organization to:\n\n\t\t(A)\tFile with the commissioner a plan for correction of the deficiency acceptable to the commissioner; and\n\t\t(B)\tCorrect the deficiency within a reasonable time, not to exceed sixty days, unless an extension of time, not to exceed sixty additional days, is granted by the commissioner.  Such a deficiency shall be deemed an impairment, and failure to correct the impairment in the prescribed time shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of the certificate of authority or for placing the health maintenance organization in conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation; and\n\n\t(2)\tUnless allowed by the commissioner, no health maintenance organization or person acting on its behalf, directly or indirectly, may renew, issue, or deliver any certificate, agreement, or contract of coverage in this State, for which a premium is charged or collected, when the health maintenance organization writing such coverage is impaired, and the fact of such impairment is known to the health maintenance organization or to such person.  However, the existence of an impairment shall not prevent the issuance or renewal of a certificate, agreement, or contract when the enrollee exercises an option granted under the plan to obtain a new, renewed, or converted coverage.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  A certificate of authority shall be suspended or revoked or an application for a certificate of authority denied, or an administrative penalty imposed, only after compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tSuspension or revocation of a certificate of authority, denial of an application, or imposition of an administrative penalty pursuant to this section shall be by written order and shall be sent to the health maintenance organization or applicant by certified or registered mail.  The written order shall state the grounds, charges, or conduct on which suspension, revocation, denial, or administrative penalty is based.  The health maintenance organization or applicant, in writing, may request a hearing pursuant to section 431:2-308; and\n\t(2)\tIf the health maintenance organization or applicant requests a hearing pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall issue a written notice of hearing and send it to the health maintenance organization or applicant by certified or registered mail and to the director of labor and industrial relations stating:\n\n\t\t(A)\tA specific time for the hearing, which may not be less than twenty nor more than thirty days after mailing of the notice of hearing; and\n\t\t(B)\tA specific place for the hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(e)  When the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is suspended, the health maintenance organization shall not, during the period of such suspension, enroll any additional enrollees except newborn children or other newly acquired dependents of existing enrollees, and shall not engage in any advertising or solicitation whatsoever.\n\t(f)  When the certificate of authority of a health maintenance organization is revoked, such organization, immediately following the effective date of the order of revocation, shall proceed to wind up its affairs, and shall conduct no further business except as may be essential to the orderly conclusion of the affairs of such organization.  It shall engage in no further advertising or solicitation whatsoever.  The commissioner, by written order, may permit such further operation of the organization as the commissioner may find to be in the best interest of enrollees, to the end that enrollees will be afforded the greatest practical opportunity to obtain continuing health care coverage.
