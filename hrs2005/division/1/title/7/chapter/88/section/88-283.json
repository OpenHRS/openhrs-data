Any notice provided to a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or determination that the notification of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be provided, shall be effective only with respect to that spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.  The system shall rely upon the representations made by a member as to whether the member has a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary and the name and address of the member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(d)  Each member, within a reasonable period of time before the member's retirement date, shall be provided a written explanation of:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe terms and conditions of the various benefit options;\n\t(2)\tThe rights of the member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary under subsection (c) to be notified of the member's election of a benefit option; and\n\t(3)\tThe member's right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election of a benefit option.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  The system shall not be liable for any false statements made by the member.\n\t(f)  In the event of the death of a member after the date of the filing of the member's written application to retire, but prior to the retirement date designated by the member, the designated beneficiary, if the member was eligible to retire on the date of the member's death, may elect to receive either:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAn allowance that would have been payable if the member had retired and had elected to receive a retirement allowance under option B; or\n\t(2)\tThe allowance under the option selected by the member which would have been payable had the member retired.\n\n\n\nThe effective date of the member's retirement shall be a first day of a month, except for the month of December when the effective date of retirement may be on the first or last day of the month, and shall be no earlier than the later of thirty days from the date the member's retirement application was filed or the day following the member's date of death.  The election may not be made if, at the time of the member's death, there are individuals who are eligible to receive death benefits under section 88-286(c) who have made a claim for the benefits; provided that, if the designated beneficiary is an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 88-286(c), the designated beneficiary may receive benefits pursuant to an election under this section pending disposition of the claim for benefits under section 88-286(c).  No death benefits will be payable under section 88-286(c) while benefits are paid pursuant to an election made under this section.\n\t(g)  In the event of the death of the retirant within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant's beneficiary may elect to receive either:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe death benefit under the retirement option selected by the retirant; or\n\t(2)\tThe death benefit under option B; provided that the difference between the benefit that the retirant received and the benefit that would have been payable to the retirant had the retirant elected to receive a retirement allowance under option B shall be returned to the system.\n\n\n\n\t(h)  The increase in the retirant's benefit under options A and B upon the death of the retirant's designated beneficiary shall be effective the first day of the month following the date of death of the designated beneficiary.  The retirant shall notify the system in writing and provide a certified copy of the beneficiary's death certificate.  The system shall make retroactive benefit payments to the retirant, not to exceed six months from the date the written notification and the certified copy of the death certificate are received by the system.  The retroactive payments shall be without interest.
