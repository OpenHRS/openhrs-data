Failure to file or correct a report when due, as required by this subpart, shall result in a penalty of $50.

All penalties collected under this section shall be deposited in the Hawaii election campaign fund;\n\t(6)\tTo hold public hearings;\n\t(7)\tTo investigate and hold hearings for receiving evidence of any violations;\n\t(8)\tTo adopt a code of fair campaign practices as a part of its rules;\n\t(9)\tTo establish rules pursuant to chapter 91;\n\t(10)\tTo request the initiation of prosecution for the violation of this subpart pursuant to section 11-229;\n\t(11)\tTo administer and monitor the distribution of public funds under this subpart;\n\t(12)\tTo suggest accounting methods for candidates, parties, and committees, as the commission may deem advisable, in connection with reports and records required by this subpart;\n\t(13)\tTo employ or contract, without regard to chapter 76 and section 28-8.3, and, at pleasure, to dismiss persons it finds necessary for the performance of its functions, including a full-time executive director, and to fix their compensation;\n\t(14)\tTo do random audits, field investigations, as necessary;\n\t(15)\tTo file for injunctive relief when indicated;\n\t(16)\tTo censure any candidate who fails to comply with the code of fair campaign practices; and\n\t(17)\tTo render advisory opinions upon the request of any candidate, candidate committee, noncandidate committee, or other person or entity subject to this chapter, as to whether the facts and circumstances of a particular case constitute or will constitute a violation of the campaign spending laws.  If no advisory opinion is rendered within ninety days after all information necessary to issue an opinion has been obtained, it shall be deemed that an advisory opinion was rendered and that the facts and circumstances of that particular case do not constitute a violation of the campaign spending laws.  The opinion rendered or deemed rendered, until amended or revoked, shall be binding on the commission in any subsequent charges concerning the candidate, candidate committee, noncandidate committee, or other person or entity subject to this chapter, who sought the opinion and acted in reliance on it in good faith, unless material facts were omitted or misstated by the persons in the request for an advisory opinion.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  In performing the functions and duties under this subpart, the commission may subpoena witnesses, examine them under oath, and require the production of books, papers, documents, or objects, to the commission office at any place in the State whether or not the subpoena is in connection with any hearing; provided that the person or documents subpoenaed shall be relevant to a matter under study or investigation by the commission.
