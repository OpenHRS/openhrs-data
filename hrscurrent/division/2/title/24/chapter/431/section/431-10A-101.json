Rev. 73 (2009).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As chapter 432D does not cover the field of managed care regulation and because \u00a7\u00a7432D-2, 432E-1, and this article can be read together and there is no explicit language or policy reason not to give each statute effect, chapter 432D does not repeal chapter 432E by implication.\u00a0 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).\n\u00a0 Properly licensed HMOs, like plaintiff, were authorized pursuant to \u00a7432D-1 to \"provide or arrange\", at their option, for the closed panel health care services required under the managed care plan program; accident and health insurers were authorized under \u00a7431:10A-205(b) to arrange for medical services for members using a defined network of providers, i.e., particular \"hospitals or persons\"; thus, this article and chapter 432D authorized both accident and health insurers and HMOs, as risk-bearing entities, to provide the closed panel product required by the managed care plan contracts.\u00a0 126 H. 326, 271 P.3d 621 (2012).\n\u00a0\nPART I.\u00a0 INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT AND HEALTH\nOR SICKNESS POLICIES\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This part shall apply to all policies of accident and health or sickness insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this State, except that nothing in this part shall apply to or affect:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Any policy of workers' compensation insurance or any policy of vehicle or liability insurance with or without supplementary coverage therein;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Any policy or contract of reinsurance;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Any blanket or group policy of insurance; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts, or contracts supplemental thereto which contain only such provisions relating to accident and health or sickness insurance as:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 Provide additional benefits in case of death, dismemberment, or loss of sight by accident; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 Operate to safeguard such contracts against lapse, or to give a special surrender value, special benefit, or an annuity in the event that the insured or annuitant shall become totally and permanently disabled, as defined by the contract or supplemental contract.
