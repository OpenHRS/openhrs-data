    "text": "(a)  A court of this State which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child-custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.  The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon the motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.\n\t(b)  Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.  For this purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWhether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child;\n\t(2)\tThe length of time the child has resided outside this State;\n\t(3)\tThe distance between the court in this State and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;\n\t(4)\tThe relative financial circumstances of the parties;\n\t(5)\tAny agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction;\n\t(6)\tThe nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including testimony of the child;\n\t(7)\tThe ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence;\n\t(8)\tThe familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation; and\n\t(9)\tThe physical and psychological health of the parties.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If a court of this State determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and proper.\n\t(d)  A court of this State may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding, while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce or other proceeding.
