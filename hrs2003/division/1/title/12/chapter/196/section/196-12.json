    "text": "Through life-cycle cost-effective energy measures, each agency shall reduce its greenhouse gas emissions attributed to facility energy use by thirty per cent by January 1, 2012, compared to emission levels in calendar year 1990.  In order to encourage optimal investment in energy improvements, agencies may count greenhouse gas reductions from improvements in non-facility energy use toward this goal to the extent that these reductions are approved by the coordinator.
