The corporation, in its discretion, may fix the rates in such amounts as will produce additional revenues (in addition to the foregoing) sufficient to amortize the cost of the housing project or projects, including equipment, over a period or periods of time that the corporation may deem advisable. \t(b)  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, if any such housing project or projects have been specified in any resolution of issuance adopted pursuant to part III, or if the income or revenues from any such project or projects have been pledged by the corporation to the payment of any bonds issued under part III, or if any of the property of any such housing project or projects is security for any such bonds, the corporation shall fix the rates of the rentals for dwelling accommodations and other facilities in the housing project or projects so specified or encumbered at increased rates that will produce the revenues required by subsection (a) and, in addition, those amounts that may be required by part III, by any resolution of issuance adopted under part III and by any bonds or mortgage or other security issued or given under part III.
