The application shall contain:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tInformation regarding the proposed acquirer;\n\t(2)\tDetails concerning the acquisition; and\n\t(3)\tAny other information that the commissioner may require.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  After receiving the proposed acquirer's application for approval and any amendments or supplements thereto, the commissioner shall promptly forward a copy of the same to the affected financial institution.

The publication shall state the fact that a change of control will take place and shall describe the effect, if any, on the operations and employees of the nondepository financial services loan company.  Publication shall be made once in a newspaper of general circulation. [L 1993, c 350, pt of \u00a71]\nRevision Note\n  \"July 1, 1993,\" substituted for \"the effective date of this chapter\"."
