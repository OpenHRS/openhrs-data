Such report to the board of directors shall contain all significant details of the action taken or the report received from another commissioner;\n\t(3)\tTo report to the board of directors when the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe from any examination, whether completed or in process, of any member company that such company may be an impaired or insolvent insurer; and\n\t(4)\tTo furnish to the board of directors the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) ratios and listings of companies not included in the ratios developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the board may use the information contained therein in carrying out its duties and responsibilities under this section.  Such report and the information contained therein shall be kept confidential by the board of directors until such time as made public by the commissioner or other lawful authority.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  The commissioner may seek the advice and recommendations of the board of directors concerning any matter affecting the commissioner's duties and responsibilities regarding the financial condition of member companies and companies seeking admission to transact insurance business in this State.\n\t(c)  The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the commissioner upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer or germane to the solvency of any company seeking to do an insurance business in this State.  Such reports and recommendations shall not be considered public documents.\n\t(d)  It shall be the duty of the board of directors, upon majority vote, to notify the commissioner of any information indicating any member insurer may be an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.\n\t(e)  The board of directors may, upon majority vote, request that the commissioner order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be an impaired or insolvent insurer.  Within thirty days of the receipt of such request, the commissioner shall begin such examination.  The examination may be conducted as a National Association of Insurance Commissioners' examination or may be conducted by such persons as the commissioner designates.  The cost of such examination shall be paid by the association and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports.  In no event shall such examination report be released to the board of directors prior to its release to the public, but this shall not excuse the commissioner from complying with subsection (a).  The commissioner shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed.  The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the commissioner but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of the examination report to the public.\n\t(f)  The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the commissioner for the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies.\n\t(g)  The board of directors shall, at the conclusion of any insurer insolvency in which the association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report to the commissioner containing such information as it may have in its possession bearing on the history and causes of such insolvency.  The board shall cooperate with the board of directors of guaranty associations in other states in preparing a report on the history and causes for insolvency of a particular insurer, and may adopt by reference any report prepared by such other associations.
