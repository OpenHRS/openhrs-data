The registration and re-registration shall expire on December 31 of an even-numbered year.  Registration information shall include but not be limited to the number of apartments managed for others as well as the number of apartments owned by the condominium hotel operator.  Any operator failing to register with the commission shall be subject to a fine not exceeding an amount equal to $25 multiplied by the aggregate number of apartments being utilized as a condominium hotel.  Each month or fraction of a month of noncompliance shall be deemed a new and separate violation;\n\t(2)\tObtain and keep current a fidelity bond from an insurance company authorized to issue fidelity bonds by the insurance division of the department of commerce and consumer affairs.

The aggregate number of apartments excludes the number of apartments owned by the condominium hotel operator either as a sole proprietor, partnership, limited liability company, or corporation or those apartments included in a registered time share plan managed by a registered time share plan manager.  The fidelity bond shall cover all of the condominium hotel operator's employees handling or having custody and control of either the condominium hotel operator's or the apartment owner's funds, or both.

The commission may adopt rules establishing conditions and terms by which it may grant a bond alternative or permit deductibles.  No condominium hotel operator shall be exempt from the fidelity bond requirement; and\n\t(3)\tPay an application fee and an initial registration or a re-registration fee as provided in rules adopted by the director of commerce and consumer affairs pursuant to chapter 91, which fees shall be deposited with the director of commerce and consumer affairs to the credit of the compliance resolution fund established pursuant to section 26-9(o);\n\n\n\nprovided that this section shall not apply to persons who are subject to section 467-2.\n\t(c)  In the course of operating a condominium hotel, neither a real estate broker license nor a real estate salesperson license shall be required of those employees of a condominium hotel operator who only perform or facilitate the delivery of customary hotel services.\n\t(d)  All employees handling or having custody or control of the funds received by the condominium hotel operator shall be covered by a fidelity bond.  The fidelity bond shall protect the condominium hotel operator against fraudulent or dishonest acts by the employees of the condominium hotel operator.\n\t(e)  As used in this section \"operating a condominium hotel\" includes the management of the apartments in a condominium project for purposes of providing transient lodging, and includes the renting or leasing of condominium apartments directly or indirectly from the apartment owners for purposes of providing transient lodging.

The condominium hotel operator shall apply all proceeds received from the fidelity bond against all losses incurred by apartment owners due to fraudulent or dishonest acts by employees.  If more than one apartment owner suffers a loss, the condominium hotel operator shall divide the proceeds among the apartment owners in proportion to each apartment owner's loss.\n\t(i)  All persons handling or having custody and control of either the condominium hotel operator's or the apartment owner's funds shall be either employees of the condominium hotel operator or principals of the condominium hotel operator.\n\t(j)  The registration and fidelity bond requirements of this section shall not apply to active real estate brokers, in compliance with and licensed under this chapter, conducting condominium hotel activity.
