    "text": "(a)\u00a0 A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer's account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in section 490:4-303.\u00a0 If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 A stop-payment order is effective for six months, but it lapses after fourteen calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period.\u00a0 A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six-month periods by a writing given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer.\u00a0 The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 490:4-402.

Manufacturers Trust Company, 199 Misc. 167, 102 N.Y.S.2d 144 (1951).\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 A payment in violation of an effective direction to stop payment is an improper payment, even though it is made by mistake or inadvertence.\u00a0 Any agreement to the contrary is invalid under Section 4-103(1) if in paying the item over the stop payment order the bank has failed to exercise ordinary care.\u00a0 The drawee is, however, entitled to subrogation to prevent unjust enrichment (Section 4-407); retains common-law defenses, e.g., that by conduct in recognizing the payment the customer has ratified the bank's action in paying over a stop payment order (Section 1-103); and retains common-law rights, e.g., to recover money paid under a mistake (Section 1-103) in cases where the payment is not made final by Section 3-418.\u00a0 It has sometimes been said that payment cannot be stopped against a holder in due course, but the statement is inaccurate.\u00a0 The payment can be stopped but the drawer remains liable on the instrument to the holder in due course (Sections 3-305, 3-413) and the drawee, if he pays, becomes subrogated to the rights of the holder in due course against the drawer.\u00a0 Section 4-407.\u00a0 Any defenses available against a holder in due course remain available to the drawer, but other defenses are cut off to the same extent as if the holder himself were bringing the action.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 3-603(1), 4-405.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Section 3-121.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Sections 3-411 and 4-303.\n\u00a0 Point 8:\u00a0 Sections 3-305, 3-413, 3-418, 4-103 and 4-407.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Account\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Burden of establishing\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Send\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
