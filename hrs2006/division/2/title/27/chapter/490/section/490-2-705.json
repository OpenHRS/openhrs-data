[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-705; HRS \u00a7490:2-705; am L 2004, c 163, \u00a714]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Sections 57-59, Uniform Sales Act; see also Sections 12, 14 and 42, Uniform Bills of Lading Act and Sections 9, 11 and 49, Uniform Warehouse Receipts Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 This section continues and develops the above sections of the Uniform Sales Act in the light of the other uniform statutory provisions noted.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\u00a0 To make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) applies the stoppage principle to other bailees as well as carriers.\n\u00a0 It also expands the remedy to cover the situations, in addition to buyer's insolvency, specified in the subsection.\u00a0 But since stoppage is a burden in any case to carriers, and might be a very heavy burden to them if it covered all small shipments in all these situations, the right to stop for reasons other than insolvency is limited to carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments.\u00a0 The seller shipping to a buyer of doubtful credit can protect himself by shipping C.O.D.\n\u00a0 Where stoppage occurs for insecurity it is merely a suspension of performance, and if assurances are duly forthcoming from the buyer the seller is not entitled to resell or divert.\n\u00a0 Improper stoppage is a breach by the seller if it effectively interferes with the buyer's right to due tender under the section on manner of tender of delivery.\u00a0 However, if the bailee obeys an unjustified order to stop he may also be liable to the buyer.\u00a0 The measure of his obligation is dependent on the provisions of the Documents of Title Article (Section 7-303).\u00a0 Subsection 3(b) therefore gives him a right of indemnity as against the seller in such a case.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 \"Receipt by the buyer\" includes receipt by the buyer's designated representative, the sub-purchaser, when shipment is made direct to him and the buyer himself never receives the goods.\u00a0 It is entirely proper under this Article that the seller, by making such direct shipment to the sub-purchaser, be regarded as acquiescing in the latter's purchase and as thus barred from stoppage of the goods as against him.\n\u00a0 As between the buyer and the seller, the latter's right to stop the goods at any time until they reach the place of final delivery is recognized by this section.\n\u00a0 Under subsection (3)(c) and (d), the carrier is under no duty to recognize the stop order of a person who is a stranger to the carrier's contract.\u00a0 But the seller's right as against the buyer to stop delivery remains, whether or not the carrier is obligated to recognize the stop order.\u00a0 If the carrier does obey it, the buyer cannot complain merely because of that circumstance; and the seller becomes obligated under subsection (3)(b) to pay the carrier any ensuing damages or charges.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 A diversion of a shipment is not a \"reshipment\" under subsection (2)(c) when it is merely an incident to the original contract of transportation.\u00a0 Nor is the procurement of \"exchange bills\" of lading which change only the name of the consignee to that of the buyer's local agent but do not alter the destination of a reshipment.\n\u00a0 Acknowledgment by the carrier as a \"warehouseman\" within the meaning of this Article requires a contract of a truly different character from the original shipment, a contract not in extension of transit but as a warehouseman.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsection (3)(c) makes the bailee's obedience of a notification to stop conditional upon the surrender of any outstanding negotiable document.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Any charges or losses incurred by the carrier in following the seller's orders, whether or not he was obligated to do so, fall to the seller's charge.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 After an effective stoppage under this section the seller's rights in the goods are the same as if he had never made a delivery.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 2-702 and 2-703.\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Sections 2-503 and 2-609, and Article 7.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Section 2-103 and Article 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Document of title\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Insolvent\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Notification\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Receipt\" of goods.\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Rights\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\nDecisions under prior law.\n\u00a0 Right of stoppage in transit, prior to statute.\u00a0 2 H. 428."
