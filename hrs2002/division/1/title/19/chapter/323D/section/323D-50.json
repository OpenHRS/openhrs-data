Each subsequent seven-day period shall constitute a separate offense. \t(b)  Any license to operate a health facility may be revoked or suspended by the department of health at any time in a proceeding before the department for any person proceeding with an action covered under section 323D-43 without a certificate of need.  If any such license is revoked or suspended by the department, the holder of the license shall be notified in writing by the department of the revocation or suspension.  Any license to operate a health facility that has been revoked under this section shall not be restored except by action of the department.\n \t(c)  Any person who violates any provision of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter, with respect to the agency's requests for reporting, may be subject to an administrative penalty not to exceed $2,000 for each seven-day period or fraction thereof that the violation continues.  The administrator of the state agency may impose the administrative penalty specified in this section by order; provided that no penalty shall be assessed unless the person charged shall have been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to chapter 91.  The administrative penalty contained in the notice of finding of violation shall become a final order unless, within twenty days of receipt of the notice, the person charged makes a written request for a hearing.  For any judicial proceeding to recover the administrative penalty imposed, the administrator need only show that notice was given, a hearing was held or the time granted for requesting a hearing has expired without such a request, the administrative penalty was imposed, and that the penalty remains unpaid.
