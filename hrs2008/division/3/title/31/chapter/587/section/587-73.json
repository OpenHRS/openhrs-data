and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 The presumption increases in importance proportionate to the youth of the child upon the date that the child was first placed under foster custody by the court; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 If the child has reached the age of fourteen, the child consents to the permanent plan, unless the court, after consulting with the child in camera, finds that it is in the best interest of the child to dispense with the child's consent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 If the court determines that the criteria set forth in subsection (a) are established by clear and convincing evidence and:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The goal of the permanent plan is for the child to be adopted or remain in permanent custody, the court shall order:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (A)\u00a0 That the existing service plan be terminated and that the prior award of foster custody be revoked;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 That permanent custody be awarded to an appropriate authorized agency;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 That an appropriate permanent plan be implemented concerning the child whereby the child will:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 Be adopted pursuant to chapter 578; provided that the court shall presume that it is in the best interests of the child to be adopted, unless the child is or will be in the home of family or a person who has become as family and who for good cause is unwilling or unable to adopt the child but is committed to and is capable of being the child's guardian or permanent custodian; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (ii)\u00a0 Remain in permanent custody until the child is subsequently adopted, placed under a guardianship, or reaches the age of majority, and that such status shall not be subject to modification or revocation except upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances to the court;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (D)\u00a0 That such further orders as the court deems to be in the best interests of the child, including but not limited to restricting or excluding unnecessary parties from participating in adoption or other subsequent proceedings, be entered;
