First Nat. Bank of South Weymouth, 184 Mass. 49, 67 N.E. 670 (1903).\u00a0 It is not intended to refer to various preliminary acts in no way close to a true decision of the bank to pay the item, such as receipt of the item over the counter for deposit, entry of a provisional credit in a passbook, or the making of a provisional settlement for the item through the clearing house, by entries in accounts, remittance or otherwise.\u00a0 All actions of this type are provisional and none of them evidences the bank's decision to pay the item.\u00a0 In this Section as in Section 4-213 reasoning such as appears in Cohen v. First Nat. Bank of Nogales, 22 Ariz. 394, 400, 198 P. 122, 124, 15 A.L.R. 701 (1921); Briviesca v. Coronado, 19 Cal.2d 244, 120 P.2d 649 (1941); White Brokerage Co. v. Cooperman, 207 Minn. 239, 290 N.W. 790 (1940); Scotts Bluff County v. First Nat. Bank of Gering, 115 Neb. 273, 212 N.W. 617, 618 (1927); Provident Savings Bank & Trust Co. v. Hildebrand, 49 Ohio App. 207, 196 N.E. 790, 791 (1934); Schaer v. First Nat. Bank of Brenham, 132 Tex. 499, 124 S.W.2d 108 (1939) (bill of exchange); Union State Bank of Lancaster v. People's State Bank of Lancaster, 192 Wis. 28, 33, 211 N.W. 931, 933 (1927); 1 Paton's Digest 1067, is rejected.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The seventh and last event conferring priority for an item and a charge to the customer's account based upon the item is stated by the language \"become accountable for the amount of the item under subsection (1)(d) of Section 4-213 and Section 4-302 dealing with the payor bank's responsibility for late return of items\".\u00a0 Under Section 4-213(1)(d) if a payor bank makes a provisional settlement for an item and fails to revoke the settlement in the time and manner permitted by statute, clearing house rule or agreement, such combination of events constitutes final payment of the item.\u00a0 Under Section 4-302 a payor bank may also become accountable for the amount of an item in certain other situations even though there has been no provisional settlement for the item or such action as constitutes final payment under Section 4-213(1).\u00a0 Expiration of the deadlines under Sections 4-213(1)(d) or 4-302 with resulting accountability by the payor bank for the amount of the item, establish priority of the item over notices, stop-orders, legal process or setoff.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 In the case of knowledge, notice, stop-orders and legal process the effective time for determining whether they were received too late to affect the payment of an item and a charge to the customer's account by reason of such payment, is receipt plus a reasonable time for the bank to act on any of these communications. \u00a0Usually a relatively short time is required to communicate to the bookkeeping department advice of one of these events but certainly some time is necessary.\u00a0 Compare Sections 1-201(27) and 4-403.\u00a0 In the case of setoff the effective time is when the setoff is actually made.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 As between one item and another no priority rule is stated, other than the convenience of the bank.\u00a0 This rule is justified because of the impossibility of stating a rule that would be fair in all cases, having in mind the almost infinite number of combinations of large and small checks in relation to the available balance on hand in the drawer's account; the possible methods of receipt; and other difficulties.\u00a0 Further, where the drawer has drawn all the checks, he should have funds available to meet all of them and has no basis for urging one should be paid before another; and the holders have no direct right against the payor bank in any event, unless of course, the bank has accepted, certified or finally paid a particular item, or has become liable for it under Section 4-302.\u00a0 Under subsection (2) the bank obviously has the right to pay items for which it is itself liable ahead of those for which it is not.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-410, 3-411, 4-213(1), 4-301, 4-302.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Accepted\".\u00a0 Section 3-410.\n\u00a0 \"Account\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Agreement\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Certified\".\u00a0 Section 3-411.\n\u00a0 \"Clearing house\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Notice\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Settle\".\u00a0 Section 4-104."
