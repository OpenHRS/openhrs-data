[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  The sections dealing with theft are framed in terms of appropriation of property of another; however, a security interest does not make the secured party an owner and the property, by reason of the security interest alone, is not the property of another.[1]  It is necessary, therefore, to provide separate penalties for \"debtors or conditional vendees who dispose of property subject to a security interest in ways that may prejudice the secured creditor.\"[2]  The requisite culpability is intent to hinder enforcement of the security interest; innocent potential hindering of such interest, such as the temporary removal of a secured chattel from the County or State, ought not to be made subject to criminal sanctions.[3] \n  The penalty provided is a misdemeanor, regardless of the amount involved.  This differs somewhat from the theft offenses.  This difference reflects the fact that generally offenders against a secured interest \"are less dangerously deviated from social norms than outright thieves who take property to which they have no claim.\"[4]  Moreover, in those cases where the actor intended, at the time the actor undertook the security obligation, to violate the terms thereof, felony penalties will be available under the theft provisions.[5] \n  Previous Hawaii law provided many offenses relating to defrauding secured creditors.  These different offenses distinguished between the kind of property involved, i.e., whether real or personal,[6] between the mode of fraud, e.g., whether the property is concealed or sold,[7] and the type of security arrangement involved, e.g., whether a mortgage of personal property or a conditional sale.[8]  The exact reason for these various provisions, sometimes with different penalties, seems unclear.  The Code provides a single unified offense with a single penalty for conduct which ought to be regarded by the penal law as presenting substantially the same type of social harm. \n__________\n Commentary:\n1.  \u00a7708-800. \n2.
