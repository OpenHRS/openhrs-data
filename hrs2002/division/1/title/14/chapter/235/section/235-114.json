    "text": "APPEAL\n\n   Appeals.  Any person aggrieved by any assessment of the tax or liability imposed by this chapter may appeal from the assessment in the manner and within the time hereinafter set forth.  Appeal may be made either to the district board of review or to the tax appeal court; provided that, for appeals other than to the board, the tax so assessed shall have been paid.  Either the taxpayer or the assessor may appeal to the tax court from a decision by the board upon which the tax so assessed shall have been paid.  If the taxpayer chose not to pay the tax when appealing to the board, and the decision by the board is appealed by the taxpayer or the decision by the board in favor of the department is not appealed, the taxpayer must pay the tax so assessed plus interest as provided in section 231-39(b)(4).\n\tIf the appeal is first made to the board, the appeal shall either be heard by the board or be transferred to the tax appeal court for hearing at the election of the taxpayer or employer.  If heard by the board, an appeal shall lie from the decision thereof to the tax appeal court and to the supreme court in the manner and with the costs provided by chapter 232.  The supreme court shall prescribe forms to be used in the appeals.  The forms shall show the amount of taxes or liability upon the basis of the taxpayer's computation of the taxpayer's taxable income or the employer's computation of the employer's liability, the amount upon the basis of the assessor's computation, the amount upon the basis of the decisions of the board of review and tax appeal court, if any, and the amount in dispute.  If or when the appeal is filed with or transferred to the tax appeal court, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the appeal, subject to appeal to the supreme court as is provided in chapter 232.\n\tAny taxpayer or employer appealing from any assessment of income taxes or liability shall lodge with the assessor or assistant assessor a notice of the appeal in writing, stating the ground of the taxpayer's or employer's objection to the additional assessment or any part thereof.  The taxpayer or employer shall also file the notice of appeal with the board or the tax appeal court at any time within thirty days subsequent to the date when the notice of assessment was mailed properly addressed to the taxpayer or employer at the taxpayer's or employer's last known residence or place of business.  Except as otherwise provided, the manner of taking the appeal, the costs applicable thereto, and the hearing and disposition thereof, including the distribution of costs and of taxes paid by the taxpayer pending the appeal, shall be as provided in chapter 232.\n\tThe tax appeal court may allow an individual taxpayer to file an appeal without payment of the net income tax in cases where the total tax liability does not exceed $50,000 in the aggregate for all tax years, upon proof that the taxpayer would be irreparably injured by payment of the tax.
