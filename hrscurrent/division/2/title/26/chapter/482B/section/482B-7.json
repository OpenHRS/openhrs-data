    "text": "An action for misappropriation must be brought within three years after the misappropriation is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.\u00a0 For the purposes of this section, a continuing misappropriation constitutes a single claim. [L 1989, c 221, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The statute of limitations for plaintiff's claim for trade secret misappropriation was not tolled by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel.\u00a0 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015).\n\u00a0 Trade secret misappropriation claim was time barred; the limitations period began upon plaintiff's suspicion of wrongdoing in the summer of 2008, notwithstanding whether plaintiff decided to conduct further investigation at that time.\u00a0 Thus, the statute of limitations expired in the summer of 2011.\u00a0 92 F. Supp. 3d 982 (2015)."
