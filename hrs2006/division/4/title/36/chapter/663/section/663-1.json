Supp. 1523.\n\u00a0\nBad faith.\n\u00a0 Hawaii supreme court, seeking to avoid inequitable or absurd result, would allow plaintiff's bad faith claim, where plaintiff submitted claims to defendant insurer for losses suffered as a third-party beneficiary of insurance contract.\u00a0 947 F. Supp. 429.\n\u00a0 Independent cause of action for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing would not lie, where there was no coverage liability on underlying insurance policy.\u00a0 955 F. Supp. 1218.\n\u00a0 Where defendant contended that claim for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was barred by two-year statute of limitations governing damage to persons and property (\u00a7657-7), since there is no element in the cause of action for bad faith that requires a plaintiff to suffer personal injury, it is not in reality a cause of action based upon a \"personal injury\", and the applicable statute of limitations is six years and is found in the catchall provision of \u00a7657-1 (\u00a7657-1(4)).\u00a0 986 F. Supp. 1334.\n\u00a0 Limitations period applicable to cause of action for bad faith, discussed; where complaint was not filed until almost one year after the limitations period had lapsed, to the extent that complaint alleged a claim for the tort of bad faith denial of benefits, summary judgment granted in favor of defendant as to plaintiff's claim for tort of bad faith.\u00a0 11 F. Supp. 2d 1204.\u00a0 \n\u00a0 Violations of the unfair settlement provision, \u00a7431:13-103(a), may be used as evidence to indicate bad faith in accordance with the guidelines of Best Place, Inc. v. Penn America Ins. Co.\u00a0 27 F. Supp. 2d 1211.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided to plaintiff by chapter 386; prior to filing a separate suit for bad faith denial of benefits or payments, plaintiff must first exhaust all available administrative remedies before the department of labor and industrial relations, disability compensation division.\u00a0 28 F. Supp. 2d 588.\n\u00a0 Insurer's motion granted to extent it sought summary judgment as to claims against defendant, where uncontradicted evidence was that defendant was the claims handler for subject insurance policy;\u00a0 defendant did not have a contract with plaintiffs; defendant could not be liable to plaintiffs for bad faith.\u00a0 74 F. Supp. 2d 975.\n\u00a0 Insurer's motion for summary judgment granted on defendant's counterclaim alleging that insurer acted in tortious breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its failure to pay underinsured motorist policy benefits, improper use of \"excuse\" that defendant violated consent-to-settle clause, and wrongful pursuit of its offset theory.\u00a0 176 F. Supp. 2d 1005.\n\u00a0 Hawaii's Best Place bad faith tort is law that impacts insurance, but does not solely regulate it; therefore, plaintiff's claim as stated arising under Best Place bad faith tort did not fit within Employee Retirement Income Security Act's (ERISA) saving clause.\u00a0 Controlling precedent mandated that plaintiff's claim was related to the processing of a claim and was preempted by ERISA because ERISA's civil remedy was plaintiff's sole avenue of relief.\u00a0 242 F. Supp. 2d 752.\n\u00a0 Where insured alleged that insurer breached covenant of good faith and fair dealing by initiating action for declaratory judgment, insured would be unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that insurer's filing of lawsuit was based on an interpretation of disability insurance policy that was unreasonable; among other things, a reasonable jury could decide issue of fraud in insurer's favor based upon insured's failure to include 1990 surgery on insured's application for the policy.\u00a0 248 F. Supp. 2d 974.\n\u00a0 Insurance company did not breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it decided not to defend the operator of a concrete recycling plant or indemnify the owner where, inter alia, it appeared that plaintiffs did not disagree with insurance company's assertion that at a minimum, there was a genuine dispute as to whether coverage existed under the insurance policy.\u00a0 307 F. Supp. 2d 1170.\n\u00a0 Bad faith cause of action may be brought by first-party insured for insurer misconduct.\u00a0 82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.\n\u00a0 Breach of implied contractual duties owed by workers' compensation insurer to employee, including duty to handle and pay claims in good faith, gives rise to independent tort cause of action by employee, the intended third-party beneficiary.\u00a0 83 H. 457, 927 P.2d 858.\n\u00a0 Where insured presented evidence that raised genuine issue of material fact as to insurer's liability for bad faith if insurer's law firm's conduct of defense breached law firm's duties towards insured and breach was causally induced by insurer's actions, summary judgment erroneously entered in favor of insurer on insured's bad faith claim.\u00a0 90 H. 39, 975 P.2d 1159.\n\u00a0 Any formal recognition of a claim for relief in favor of an injured claimant against a third-party tortfeasor's insurance company for bad faith settlement practices would require the assignment of the insured tortfeasor's rights arising from an underlying insurance contract to the injured plaintiff; the tort of bad faith settlement practices arises only from a contract of insurance.\u00a0 105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.\n\u00a0 Where there was no underlying insurance contract from which the duty of good faith settlement practices could arise, injured third-party claimant had no right to sue self-insured car rental company for bad faith.\u00a0 105 H. 112, 94 P.3d 667.\n\u00a0 Where insurer's denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits was based upon an open question of law--whether \"the reasons\" as used in \u00a7431:10C-304(3)(B) means \"all reasons\"--there was no bad faith on the part of insurer for not having stated all the reasons for its denial of plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleged that insurer handled the denial of plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits in bad faith, plaintiff was not precluded from bringing bad faith claim even where there was no coverage liability on the underlying policy; thus, trial court erred in determining that, because plaintiff's breach of contract claim failed, plaintiff's bad faith claim must fail.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.\n\u00a0 Where the question of whether the underinsured motorist benefits settlement from non-party insurer would trigger the two-year statute of limitations under \u00a7431:10C-315(a) (1993) for plaintiff's claim against defendant insurer was an open question of law until this case, there was no bad faith on the part of defendant insurer for having denied plaintiff's claim for no-fault benefits on the basis of the statute of limitations.\u00a0 109 H. 537, 128 P.3d 850.\n\u00a0 As action for bad faith against insurer is an independent tort, the proper limitation provision for bringing an action should not be that provided in the insurance policy, but rather that provided in \u00a7657-7, which limits causes of action for torts to two years.\u00a0 88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639.\n\u00a0 Where insured's bad faith claim was not \"any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing\" under \u00a7658-5, and action for bad faith in the first-party insurance context is independent of the policy, an ongoing appraisal process did not bar insured from bringing a lawsuit alleging bad faith handling of insured's claim.\u00a0 88 H. 442 (App.), 967 P.2d 639.\n\u00a0\nChildren.\n\u00a0 Parent liable for tort of minor child when child would be liable.\u00a0 15 H. 124; 23 H. 541, 543.\u00a0 Father not liable for act of infant unemancipated from childish instincts.\u00a0 8 H. 715.\u00a0 Liability of infant for damages to hired chattel resulting from infant's immoderate use of the chattel.\u00a0 8 H. 237.\u00a0 Contributory negligence of mother of six-year old child not imputed to child. 29 H. 604.\u00a0 See 47 H. 281, 287, 386 P.2d 872.\u00a0 Degree of care toward children on highway.\u00a0 40 H. 417.\n\u00a0 Child has no cause of action for injuries to parent not resulting in death.\u00a0 41 H. 634; 244 F.2d 604.\n\u00a0 A six-year old may be capable of contributory negligence; minor's standard of care.\u00a0 47 H. 281, 386 P.2d 872.\n\u00a0 Minor children liable in tort to parents, when.\u00a0 51 H. 74, 450 P.2d 998.\u00a0 Minor children may sue their parents for negligence.\u00a0 51 H. 484, 462 P.2d 1007.\n\u00a0 Negligence; standard of care for children.\u00a0 54 H. 611, 513 P.2d 487.\n\u00a0 Parent may recover damages for loss of filial consortium of an injured adult child.\u00a0 71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\n\u00a0\nCausation.\n\u00a0 Motion to dismiss count of plaintiffs' third amended complaint alleging that the design, manufacture, and/or production of subject chemicals by certain defendants constituted an ultrahazardous activity granted; the complaint was devoid of any allegation that plaintiffs' claimed injuries flowed directly from the act of manufacturing the subject chemicals, nor could plaintiffs make such causation allegations.\u00a0 293 F. Supp. 2d 1140.\n\u00a0 Intervening negligence and proximate causation.\u00a0 45 H. 128, 363 P.2d 969.\n\u00a0 Negligence.\u00a0 Causation construed.\u00a0 57 H. 460, 558 P.2d 1018.\n\u00a0 Where causation is a primary issue, it is plain and reversible error for a trial court not to explain the meaning of \"legal cause\" to a jury.\u00a0 77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.\n\u00a0 When read as a whole, or when considering both jury instruction where trial court used term \"legal cause\" as opposed to \"substantial factor\" and instruction that properly defined \"legal cause\", the instructions given were not prejudicially insufficient, erroneous, inconsistent, or misleading.\u00a0 78 H. 230, 891 P.2d 1022.\n\u00a0 Where department of education's (DOE) negligent acts contributed to the conditions that facilitated the teacher's molestation of the girl students, the DOE's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff parents' injuries; thus, trial court did not err in finding that the DOE's negligence legally caused the plaintiff parents' various psychological injuries.\u00a0 100 H. 34, 58 P.3d 545.\n\u00a0 In breach of express warranty actions based on seller's failure to deliver goods in conformance with an express promise, affirmation of fact, or description, \"substantial factor\" test proper standard to apply in determining proximate cause.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0\nDamages.\n\u00a0 Defendant insurance company's motion for summary judgment granted as to plaintiff's claim for punitive damages, where plaintiff alleged that defendant's conduct was wanton and oppressive; there was not sufficient evidence to reach clear and convincing standard, and thus the question of punitives could not be put to a jury.\u00a0 999 F. Supp. 1369.\n\u00a0 If plaintiff succeeded on bad faith claim, and plaintiff could show that plaintiff's emotional distress damages were proximately caused by defendant insurance company's actions, plaintiff could recover damages for plaintiff's emotional distress as incidentally flowing from the breach.\u00a0 999 F. Supp. 1369.\n\u00a0 Any recovery of damages for loss of consortium by (former) spouse limited to duration of plaintiffs' (i.e., patient and patient's spouse) marriage.\u00a0 125 F. Supp. 2d 1249.\n\u00a0 Punitive damages not allowed against principal unless principal participated in the wrongful act or authorized or approved it.\u00a0 8 H. 411; 24 H. 579; 29 H. 524.\u00a0 Punitive damages may be awarded though actual damages nominal.\u00a0 40 H. 492.\n\u00a0 Explosives, concussion damage.\u00a0 42 H. 353.\n\u00a0 Use of mathematical formula to compute damages for pain and suffering improper.\u00a0 47 H. 408, 390 P.2d 740; 48 H. 22, 395 P.2d 365.\u00a0 But see \u00a7635-52.\n\u00a0 Defendant title company was liable to plaintiffs only for damages limited to the transaction for which certificate of title search was intended to influence, that is, only for damages plaintiffs suffered in the transaction wherein they purchased the property; defendant's negligence was not the proximate cause of the loss of anticipated profits.\u00a0 51 H. 462, 462 P.2d 905.\n\u00a0 Clear and convincing standard of proof adopted for all punitive damage claims.\u00a0 71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\n\u00a0 Punitive damages may be awarded in products liability action based on underlying theory of strict liability where plaintiff proves requisite aggravating conduct on part of defendant.\u00a0 71 H. 1, 780 P.2d 566.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff has duty to mitigate damages.\u00a0 56 H. 507, 542 P.2d 1265.\n\u00a0 Mental distress damages may be recovered in a products liability implied warranty action.\u00a0 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.\n\u00a0 Apportionment of damages, discussed, where plaintiff had a pre-existing condition, had been injured or plaintiff's condition had been aggravated by independent acts of successive tortfeasors, and had allegedly caused some of plaintiff's own injuries after the accident from which plaintiff had brought suit.\u00a0 77 H. 282, 884 P.2d 345.\n\u00a0 Circuit court correctly granted plaintiff-appellee's motion for directed verdict as to punitive damages regarding interference with contract claim, where defendants-appellants failed to show actual damages.\u00a0 78 H. 40, 890 P.2d 277.\n\u00a0 Punitive damages may not be awarded in bad faith tort case unless evidence reflects something more than the conduct necessary to establish the tort.\u00a0 82 H. 120, 920 P.2d 334.\n\u00a0 Emotional distress damages resulting from breach of contract recoverable only where parties specifically provide for them in the contract or where the nature of the contract clearly indicates that such damages are within the parties' contemplation or expectation in the event of a breach.\u00a0 89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.\n\u00a0 Tort recovery, including recovery of punitive damages, is not allowed under Hawaii law for breach of contract in the absence of conduct that (1) violates a duty that is independently recognized by principles of tort law and (2) transcends the breach of the contract.\u00a0 89 H. 234, 971 P.2d 707.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiff alleging defamation failed to prove \"actual damages\" caused by newspaper's negligence, summary judgment for newspaper properly granted.\u00a0 89 H. 254, 971 P.2d 1089.\n\u00a0 Where a person is deprived of the use of his or her property due to the tortious conduct of another, he or she may recover \"loss of use\" damages; such damages are, as a general matter, limited to the period of time reasonably necessary to obtain a replacement, to effect repairs, or the date upon which the property is returned.\u00a0 97 H. 38, 33 P.3d 204.\n\u00a0 Under Hawaii law, a party is not immune from liability for civil damages based upon that party's fraud engaged in during prior litigation proceedings.\u00a0 102 H. 149, 73 P.3d 687.\n\u00a0 Where award of general damages, consisting of damages to credit, general reputation, and loss of business opportunities, were personal to aircraft lessors, appellate court erred by holding that general damages were assignable.\u00a0 102 H. 189, 74 P.3d 12.\n\u00a0 The collateral source rule prohibits reducing a plaintiff's award of medical special damages to reflect the discounted amount paid by Medicare/Medicaid; the amounts billed in excess of the Medicare/Medicaid amount paid are not irrelevant or inadmissible on the issue of medical special damages.\u00a0 106 H. 81, 101 P.3d 1149.\n\u00a0 Inconsistent for jury not to award pain and suffering general damages where it awarded special damages for medical expenses and lost wages.\u00a0 80 H. 188 (App.), 907 P.2d 774.\n\u00a0 \"Pure\" comparative negligence principles should be applied to reduce a plaintiff's recovery in those tort actions for breach of express warranty where a plaintiff is found to be negligent.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0\nDefamation.\n\u00a0 Defendants' statements implying attorney's poor client representation constitutionally protected speech and not defamatory where general and specific contexts in which statements were made did not imply assertion of an objective fact and statements were incapable of being proved true or false.\u00a0 56 F.3d 1147.\n\u00a0 Totality of the circumstances revealed that statements by president of labor organization were a call to arms, not assertions of objective fact; the statements were not defamatory, and therefore were fully protected by federal labor law.\u00a0 302 F.3d 998.\n\u00a0 False statement that attorney had been a prosecutor in South Africa was libelous per se; no recovery for defamation based on a truthful statement of fact.\u00a0 825 F. Supp. 906.\n\u00a0 Some statements that allegedly defamed plaintiff or cast plaintiff in false light were privileged expressions of opinion.\u00a0 825 F. Supp. 906.\n\u00a0 Plaintiff was not a public figure for purposes of its defamation claim.\u00a0 833 F. Supp. 802.\n\u00a0 Statements in editorial about plaintiff (when plaintiff was mayor) were protected by First Amendment and thus, not actionable.\u00a0 930 F. Supp. 1403.\n\u00a0 Where alleged defamatory statements occurred during a conversation between an employee of defendant and representatives of defendant's temporary disability insurer, there was a qualified privilege as defendant and its insurer shared a common interest, their business relationship; an employer who communicates information to its insurance carrier is acting, at the very least, to promote the private interest of the companies; questions remained regarding potential abuse of the privilege.\u00a0 26 F.

Supp. 2d 1192.\n\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiff's claim for damages resulting from defendants' allegedly tortious interference with plaintiff's contractual relations with its customers was preempted, where any determination of the applicability of state tort law would require consideration of the scope of various provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between plaintiff and defendant union; even if the claim were not preempted, it would still be dismissed.\u00a0 250 F.

Supp. 2d 1101.\n\u00a0 Count of plaintiff's complaint sounding in common law wrongful termination in violation of public policy failed to state a claim; there could be no statutorily-based Parnar common law claims where, as with the federal Pregnancy Discrimination and Family and Medical Leave Acts, the statutes themselves provided comprehensive remedial schemes to vindicate their public policies.\u00a0 324 F. Supp. 2d 1144.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' spoliation claims failed as a matter of law, where plaintiffs based their spoliation claims on the destruction of plants from the alleged Costa Rica field test; destruction of the plants did not result in plaintiffs' inability to prove the underlying cases.\u00a0 330 F.

court thus erred in granting summary judgment in favor of dealership on the basis that plaintiffs' damages were inadequate.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.\n\u00a0 The three to five dollars plaintiffs claimed having spent on gasoline responding to car dealership's advertisement, if proved, satisfied the requirement of \"substantial pecuniary\u00a0 loss\" necessary to support a claim for relief grounded in fraud.\u00a0 98 H. 309, 47 P.3d 1222.\n\u00a0 State employees' retirement system board has a fiduciary duty to provide its members with clear, understandable information concerning retirement benefits;

evidence merely of a breached contract was insufficient to sustain a tortious interference with contractual relations claim; thus, trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of bank on broker's tortious interference with contractual relations claim.\u00a0 109 H. 35 (App.), 122 P.3d 1133.\n\u00a0 Sale by real estate broker of client's property to a party in which broker had pecuniary interest without disclosure to client was constructive fraud.\u00a0 2 H.
