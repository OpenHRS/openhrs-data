Certain terms defined for purposes of Hawaii Revised Statutes, see \u00a7\u00a71-18 to 22.\n  While common meaning is general rule, where statute involves a trade presumption is that words have trade meaning.  45 H. 167, 177, 363 P.2d 990.\n  Modern meaning given, as distinguished from ancient restricted meaning.  34 H. 245.  Commonly accepted meaning, as distinguished from fine distinctions of law of future interests.  46 H. 375, 381 P.2d 687.\n  Where statute does not refer to renewal of a license and treats all licenses as similar whether first or subsequent, circumstance that in popular mind there is a difference not sufficient to alter plain meaning.  12 H. 303, 306.\n  Other cases where usual sense given or statute cited:  3 H. 793; 5 H. 321; 8 H. 259; 25 H. 747, 754; 39 H. 100, 109.\n  Whatever is necessarily or plainly implied is as much a part of the statute as that which is expressed.  58 H. 53, 564 P.2d 436.\n  Courts are bound to give effect to all parts of a statute if such a construction can legitimately be found.  60 H. 487, 591 P.2d 607.\n  Cited in construing \"accident.\"  1 H.
