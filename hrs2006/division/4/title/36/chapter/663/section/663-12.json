Supp. 854.\n\u00a0 Settlement did not bar defendant's contribution rights against State where settlement extinguished State's liability to plaintiffs; apportionment of fault where negligent employee, acting for both joint tortfeasors, performed services primarily benefiting one tortfeasor.\u00a0 643 F. Supp. 593.\n\u00a0 Party was not allowed to recover as a joint tortfeasor.\u00a0 682 F. Supp. 1499.\n\u00a0 In reviewing apportionment of damages, supreme court should confine its question to whether apportionment was so erroneous as to shock the moral sense.\u00a0 45 H. 128, 363 P.2d 969.\n\u00a0 A party who settles before suit and is found not negligent in action for contribution is not a joint tortfeasor and is therefore not entitled to contribution but may recover under subrogation.\u00a0 53 H. 398, 495 P.2d 585.\n\u00a0 Based on \u00a7663-17(c) and this section, because joint tortfeasor landlord did not file a cross-claim against joint tortfeasor tenant, landlord did not have a right of contribution from tenant, and trial court properly acted within its discretion in dismissing tenant from the case.\u00a0 93 H. 417, 5 P.3d 407.\n\u00a0 Form of final judgment with respect to joint tortfeasor's claim for contribution.\u00a0 6 H.
