The effective date of the member's retirement shall be a first day of a month, except for the month of December when the effective date of retirement may be on the first or last day of the month, and shall be no earlier than the later of thirty days from the date the member's retirement application was filed or the day following the member's date of death.\n\t(c)  If a retirant dies within one year after the date of retirement, the retirant's beneficiary may elect to receive either the death benefit under the retirement allowance option selected by the member, or the benefits that would have been paid under section 88-338 had the retirant died immediately prior to retirement, less any payments received by the retirant.\n\t(d)  Any election of a mode of retirement allowance shall be irrevocable.\n\t(e)  No election under this section shall take effect unless:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe spouse or reciprocal beneficiary of the member is furnished written notification that:\n\n\t\t(A)\tSpecifies the retirement date, the benefit option selected, and the beneficiary designated by the member;\n\t\t(B)\tProvides information indicating the effect of the election; and\n\t\t(C)\tIs determined adequate by rules adopted by the board in accordance with chapter 91; \n\n\t(2)\tThe member selects option 2 or option 3 under section 88-83 and designates the spouse or reciprocal beneficiary as the beneficiary; or\n\t(3)\tIt is established to the satisfaction of the board that the notice required under paragraph (1) cannot be provided because:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThere is no spouse or reciprocal beneficiary;\n\t\t(B)\tThe spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be located;\n\t\t(C)\tThe member has failed to notify the system that the member has a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or has failed to provide the system with the name and address of the member's spouse or reciprocal beneficiary; or\n\t\t(D)\tOf other reasons, as established by board rules adopted in accordance with chapter 91. \n\n\n\n\n\n\tAny notice provided to a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary, or determination that the notification of a spouse or reciprocal beneficiary cannot be provided shall be effective only with respect to that spouse or reciprocal beneficiary.
