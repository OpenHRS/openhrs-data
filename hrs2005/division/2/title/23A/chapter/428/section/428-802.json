    "text": "(a)  Subject to subsection (b), a limited liability company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business.\n\t(b)  At any time after the dissolution of a limited liability company and before the winding up of its business is completed, the members, including a dissociated member whose dissociation caused the dissolution, may unanimously waive the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated.  In that case:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe limited liability company resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred and any liability incurred by the company or a member after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if the dissolution had never occurred; and\n\t(2)\tThe rights of a third party accruing under section 428-804(a) or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected.
