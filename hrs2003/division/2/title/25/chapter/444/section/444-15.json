These fees shall be as provided in rules adopted by the director pursuant to chapter 91.  Failure, neglect, or refusal of any licensee to pay these fees and to submit all documents required by the board on or before September 30 of each even-numbered year shall constitute a forfeiture of the licensee's license.\n\t(b)  Any forfeited license may be restored upon submittal of all required documents and fees, plus a penalty fee, within sixty days from September 30 of the even-numbered year.\n\t(c)  Upon written request of a licensee, the board may place that person's active license in an inactive status.  The licensee, upon payment of the inactive license fee, may continue inactive for the biennial period.  Failure, neglect, or refusal of any licensee in inactive status to pay the inactive license fee shall constitute a forfeiture of the license.  The license may be reactivated at any time during the biennial period by making written request to the board and by fulfilling all the requirements, including the payment of the appropriate fees.  While in an inactive status, a licensee shall not engage in contracting; a licensee who violates this prohibition shall be subject to discipline under this chapter and the board's rules.\n\t(d)  For purposes of this chapter, the dishonoring of any check upon first deposit shall constitute a failure to meet the fee requirements.
