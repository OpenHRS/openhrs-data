    "text": "(a)  When a child reasonably believed to come within section 571-11(2) is referred to the court or other designated agency, informal adjustment may be provided to the child by an intake officer duly authorized by the family court only where the facts reasonably appear to establish prima facie jurisdiction and are admitted and where a consent is obtained from the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian, and the child, if of sufficient age and understanding.  Informal adjustment under this section may include, among other suitable methods, programs, and procedures, listed in section 571-31.4(b), except section 571-31.4(b)(1), and provided that placement with shelter facilities under section 571-31.4(b)(9) shall be on a nonsecure basis unless the child is processed under subsection (b) of this section. \n\t(b)  In the event resources and services for informal adjustment are not available, have failed, are reasonably believed to fail if attempted, or are unable to respond to the needs of the child or family, the intake officer shall proceed with formal action, or take such action as is otherwise allowed under this chapter.
