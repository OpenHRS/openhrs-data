The facilities shall be deemed to have interim status.  This subsection shall not apply to any facility which has been previously denied a permit under section 3005 of RCRA, 42 United States Code \u00a76925 or section 342J-5 or if authority to operate the facility under section 3005 of RCRA, 42 United States Code \u00a76925 or this section has been previously terminated.\n\t(c)  The director shall have the authority to publish schedules for the submission of permit applications and other information reasonably required and or requested in order to process that application.  Failure to comply with such schedules shall be a basis for automatic termination of interim status.
