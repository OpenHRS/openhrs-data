This document shall be submitted to the commissioner for approval.  Sixty days after receiving such approval, no insurer may deliver a policy or contract described in section 431:16-203 to a policyholder or contract holder unless the document is delivered to the policyholder or contract holder at the time of delivery of the policy or contract except if subsection (d) applies.  The document should also be available upon request by a policyholder.  The distribution, delivery or contents or interpretation of this document shall not mean that either the policy or the contract or the holder thereof would be covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer.  The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to this part may require.  Failure to receive this document does not give the policyholder, contract holder, certificate holder, or insured any greater rights than those stated in this part.\n\t(c)  The document prepared under subsection (b) shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face.  The commissioner shall promulgate a rule establishing the form and content of the disclaimer.
