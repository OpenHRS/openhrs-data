This information shall be secured only for the purpose of conducting the criminal history record check authorized by this section.\n\t(b)  The applicant shall submit to the liquor commission:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tA statement signed under penalty of law as to whether the applicant has ever been convicted of a crime other than a minor traffic violation;\n\t(2)\tWritten consent to request and obtain criminal history record information for verification; and\n\t(3)\tPermission to be fingerprinted.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The liquor commission shall obtain criminal history record information through the Hawaii criminal justice data center on the applicant.
