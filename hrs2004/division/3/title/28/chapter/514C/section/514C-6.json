    "text": "(a)  The association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation may purchase the leased fee interest in the land; provided that at least seventy-five per cent of the condominium unit lessees or cooperative unit lessees approve of the purchase.  If the seller is also a condominium unit lessee or cooperative unit lessee, the seller's interest shall be disregarded in the computation to achieve the seventy-five per cent requirement.  As used herein, seventy-five per cent of the condominium unit lessees means the lessees of units to which seventy-five per cent of the common interests are appurtenant and seventy-five per cent of the cooperative unit lessees means shareholders having at least seventy-five per cent of the shares in the cooperative housing corporation.\n\tIf the association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation accepts the seller's offer to purchase the leased fee interest in the land, the following powers, in addition to any other powers, shall be conferred upon the association of owners or cooperative housing corporation:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tTo purchase or otherwise acquire, own, improve, use, and otherwise deal in and with the leased fee interest to the land or any or all undivided interests therein; \n\t(2)\tTo incur liabilities, borrow money, and secure any of its obligations by mortgage or pledge of all or any portion of its property, assessments, and funds;\n\t(3)\tTo assess, in a fair and equitable manner, the condominium unit lessees or cooperative unit lessees for the expenses incurred in acquiring the leased fee interest to the land, or to service any debt associated therewith; and\n\t(4)\tTo sell the leased fee interest appurtenant to a condominium unit to any condominium unit lessee or subsequent purchaser of such unit.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  No conveyance of the leased fee interest to or by an association of owners or cooperative housing corporation, and no borrowing, mortgage, or pledge by an association of owners or cooperative housing corporation shall be invalid because it was without capacity or power to do such an act or to make or receive such conveyance, transfer, or loan.\n\t(c)  No condominium lessee shall be compelled to participate in the purchase of the leased fee interest of the property, but may instead pay lease rent to the association of owners.
