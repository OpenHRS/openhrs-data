The Legislature revised  and added the provision for mandatory life imprisonment without parole (but subject to commutation) now contained in subsection (a).  The following commentary is based on the original proposal.]\n\n\t\tThe crime of murder is the most serious offense in the penal law; because of this the Code departs from the general policy underlying \u00a7706-605 and makes murder a non- probationable offense in all cases.\n\t\tThe flexible mode of disposition provided by \u00a7706-605 is premised on the rationale that, although most class A felons will, perhaps, be sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment, no legislative classification can take account of unusual circumstances or extreme mitigations which would indicate that a sentence to probation, rather than to imprisonment, is warranted.  The case is even stronger for defendants convicted of less serious offenses.  However, in providing a bar to probation for persons convicted of murder (i.e., intentionally or knowingly causing the death of another person), the Code takes the position that, regardless of the information obtained by pre-sentence procedure, the court's options ought to be limited to which maximum, life or twenty years, will be applicable to the convicted defendant's term of imprisonment.  The actual time of release from imprisonment will then be determined by the board of paroles and pardons, which will have more time and resources to devote to a more deliberate determination of the defendant's fitness to return to open society.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n  When the Legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it revised  to provide for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in the four enumerated cases specified in subsection (a).  However, the Legislature provided that upon the Governor's commutation, parole would be possible at the end of twenty years of imprisonment.  Subsection (b) essentially derived from the Proposed Draft.\n  The Conference Committee Report specifically provides that:  \"It is the intent of your Committee that the term 'peace officer' [see subsection (a)(i)] includes judges and prosecuting attorneys.  It is also the intent of your Committee that \u00a7701-101 of the Penal Code shall apply to prisoners presently serving sentences of life without parole who are, after twenty years of imprisonment, subject to the same review as provided in .\"  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n  Act 27, Session Laws 1981, eliminated the court's discretion under subsection (b) to impose a sentence of either life imprisonment with possibility of parole or twenty years imprisonment.  As amended the subsection requires the court to impose the same indeterminate sentence in all cases.\n  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, deleted the provisions concerning sentencing for murder and replaced it with criteria to be considered by a court in imposing any sentence, including the need to afford deterrence to criminal conduct and to impose just punishment.

Judge must impose sentence of life imprisonment with possibility of parole, but allowed to reduce it to twenty years if factors or circumstances warrant lesser sentence.  64 H. 193, 638 P.2d 307.\n  Sentencing court abused discretion by finding defendant committed murder by hire.  67 H. 573, 698 P.2d 287.\n  Trial court abused its discretion in rigidly applying family court sentencing guidelines promulgated without legislative authority.  72 H. 521, 824 P.2d 837.\n  Sentencing court may properly consider criminal convictions that occurred subsequent to original illegal sentence when applying  factors on resentencing.  79 H. 281, 901 P.2d 481.\n  Where no evidence that group engaged in or endorsed illegal activities, insufficient evidence to establish any reasonable correlation between defendant's association with group and imposition of consecutive prison sentences under paragraph (1).  81 H. 309, 916 P.2d 1210.\n  No abuse of discretion in court sentencing defendant to extended terms of imprisonment under \u00a7\u00a7706-661 and 706-662 where, inter alia, court considered each of the factors enumerated in this section and all the mitigating factors raised by defendant.  83 H. 335, 926 P.2d 1258.\n  The January 1, 1987 repeal of language in subsection (b) (pre-1986 amendment) authorizing a court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for murder in cases other than described in subsection (a) (pre-1986 amendment) did not invalidate any such sentence imposed prior to the repeal date.  102 H. 282, 75 P.3d 1173.\n  A sentencing court may not impose discretionary conditions of probation pursuant to \u00a7706-624(2) unless there is a factual basis in the record indicating that such conditions \"are reasonably related to the factors set forth in this section\" and insofar as such \"conditions involve only deprivations of liberty or property\", that they are reasonably necessary for the purposes indicated in paragraph (2).  103 H. 462, 83 P.3d 725.\n  Seven-day term of imprisonment was not unreasonably related to factors set forth in this section, considering nature of offense and circumstances presented by the record.  10 H. App. 381, 876 P.2d 1331.\n  Trial court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment under \u00a7706-668.5 where, taking into consideration all of the factors set forth in this section, the court pointed to the high level of cruelty, violence, and viciousness involved in the commission of the offenses, that most of the offenses took place in front of defendant's two-year-old son, defendant's lack of remorse, the clear and present danger defendant posed to complainant and the community, and the poor prospects for defendant's rehabilitation.  106 H. 365 (App.), 105 P.3d 242.\n  Discussed:  78 H. 127, 890 P.2d 1167; 81 H. 421 (App.), 918 P.2d 228."
