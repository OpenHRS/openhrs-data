    "text": "The standards and criteria in this section shall be used to identify important agricultural lands.  Lands identified as important agricultural lands need not meet every standard and criteria listed below.  Rather, lands meeting any of the criteria below shall be given initial consideration; provided that the designation of important agricultural lands shall be made by weighing the standards and criteria with each other to meet the constitutionally mandated purposes in article XI, section 3, of the state constitution and the objectives and policies for important agricultural lands in sections 205-42 and 205-43.  The standards and criteria shall be as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tLand currently used for agricultural production;\n\t(2)\tLand with soil qualities and growing conditions that support agricultural production of food, fiber, or fuel- and energy-producing crops;\n\t(3)\tLand identified under agricultural productivity rating systems, such as the agricultural lands of importance to the State of Hawaii (ALISH) system adopted by the board of agriculture on January 28, 1977;\n\t(4)\tLand types associated with traditional native Hawaiian agricultural uses, such as taro cultivation, or unique agricultural crops and uses, such as coffee, vineyards, aquaculture, and energy production;\n\t(5)\tLand with sufficient quantities of water to support viable agricultural production;\n\t(6)\tLand whose designation as important agricultural lands is consistent with general, development, and community plans of the county;\n\t(7)\tLand that contributes to maintaining a critical land mass important to agricultural operating productivity; and\n\t(8)\tLand with or near support infrastructure conducive to agricultural productivity, such as transportation to markets, water, or power.
