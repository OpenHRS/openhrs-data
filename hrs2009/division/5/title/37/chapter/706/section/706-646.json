[L 1998, c 269, pt of \u00a71; am L 1999, c 18, \u00a717; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a722]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 269, Session Laws 1998, added this section and \u00a7706-647 to allow victims of crime to enforce a criminal restitution order in the same manner as a civil judgment.\u00a0 This section also includes within the definition of \"victim\" a governmental entity which has reimbursed the victim for losses arising as a result of the crime, and allows the court to order restitution to be paid to the criminal injuries compensation commission if the victim has been given an award for compensation by the commission.\u00a0 Under current law, a defendant may be required by the court to pay restitution for losses caused to the victim.\u00a0 Collection of the restitution was left to governmental entities such as the judiciary, paroling authority, and department of public safety; these entities often were able to collect only a small fraction of the amount.\u00a0 Moreover, although the criminal injuries compensation commission helped victims by providing some compensation, victims of property crimes and some violent crimes were ineligible for any compensation from the commission.\u00a0 Furthermore, although a victim may bring a civil action against the defendant, the process was costly and time-consuming.\u00a0 The legislature believed that victims should have a \"fast track\" ability to be compensated for their losses by allowing victims to enforce the criminal restitution order as a civil judgment, using all of the civil collection remedies.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 89, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3008.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, require that when restitution is ordered, the amount ordered is not based on the defendant's financial ability to make restitution, but the defendant's financial ability to make restitution [shall] be considered in establishing the time and manner of payment.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06."
