In the event that, but for this sentence, deductions could not be had for expenses of services because such services were rendered by the same person or persons constituting the public utility or could not be had for income taxes, because such taxes were levied against the person or persons constituting the public utility in the person's or their individual capacity and not as a separate entity, there nevertheless shall be allowed as deductions in computing the net operating income (A) a reasonable allowance for the value of personal services actually rendered, and (B) such proportion of the actual amount of income taxes, federal and state, as fairly represents the portion of the income so taxed which was derived from the public utility business.\n\t\"Partner\" means the same as in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\t\"Partnership\" means the same as in the Internal Revenue Code.\n\t\"Ports\", \"airports\", or \"points in the State\" shall be deemed to be such if they are loading, unloading, transshipment, assembly, transfer, or relay points.\n\t\"Public highways\" has the meaning defined by section 264-1 including both state and county highways, but operation upon rails shall not be deemed transportation on the public highways.\n\t\"Public service company\" means a public utility, motor carrier, or contract carrier.\n\t\"Public utility\" has the meaning given that term in section 269-1.
