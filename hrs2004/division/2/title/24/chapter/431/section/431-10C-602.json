    "text": "\u00a7431:10C-602    An applicant for self-insurance shall:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(1)\t(A)\tFile with the commissioner and maintain a bond of a surety company authorized to do business in the State, conditioned for the payment of benefits and amounts as would be payable if the applicant were insured under a motor vehicle insurance policy as prescribed in this article.  The bond shall be in the form and penal sum acceptable to the commissioner, but in no event shall be less than $300,000, and shall provide that the bond may not be canceled or otherwise terminated until two years have elapsed from the last day the applicant was self-insured, unless the commissioner has given prior written consent.  It shall be undertaken and may be enforced in the name of \"Commissioner of Insurance, State of Hawaii\".  The surety company may not cancel the bond for the period of certification; or \n\t\t(B)\tDeposit with the commissioner cash or those securities as may be legally purchased for investment by insurance companies under this chapter and evidence satisfactory to the commissioner that there are no unsatisfied judgments against the applicant.  As used herein, \"cash\" includes an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a federally insured financial institution whose principal office is located in this State.  Prior to the issuance of a certificate of self-insurance the securities and cash, if appropriate, shall be registered in the name of the \"Commissioner of Insurance, State of Hawaii\".  The deposit shall be held to satisfy claims for personal injury protection benefits and liability coverage as prescribed in this article.  The commissioner shall deposit the cash or securities with the director of finance.  The applicant shall execute an agreement satisfactory in form to the commissioner with respect to the deposit.  The cash or market value of the securities deposited shall be in an amount determined by the commissioner to afford security substantially equivalent to that afforded under a motor vehicle insurance policy, but in no event less than $300,000 and shall provide that the cash or securities shall not be withdrawn until two years have elapsed from the last day the applicant was self-insured, unless the commissioner has given prior written consent; and\n\n\t(2)\tFurnish the commissioner satisfactory proof of the applicant's solvency and financial ability to timely pay benefits and amounts as would be payable if the applicant were insured under this article.  The commissioner shall consider the assets, liabilities, profit, loss records, and liquidity of the applicant, the number of vehicles involved, the exposure, and other factors appropriate to determining whether the applicant qualifies as a self-insurer.
