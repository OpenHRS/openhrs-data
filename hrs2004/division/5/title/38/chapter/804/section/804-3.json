For purposes of subsection (b)(3) and (4) a rebuttable presumption arises that the person poses a serious danger to any person or community or will engage in illegal activity where the court determines that: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe defendant has been previously convicted of a serious crime involving violence against a person within the ten-year period preceding the date of the charge against the defendant; \n\t(2)\tThe defendant is already on bail on a felony charge involving violence against a person; or \n\t(3)\tThe defendant is on probation or parole for a serious crime involving violence to a person. \n\n\n\n\t(d)  If, after a hearing the court finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person when required or the safety of any other person or community, bail may be denied.
