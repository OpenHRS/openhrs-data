A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged.  A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused.  A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused. [L 1982, c 171, pt of \u00a72]"
