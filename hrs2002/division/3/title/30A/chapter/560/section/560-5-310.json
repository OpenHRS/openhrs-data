    "text": "If an incapacitated person has no guardian of the person and an emergency exists, the family court may exercise the power of a guardian of the person pending notice and hearing.  If the family court finds that the welfare of the incapacitated person requires immediate action, it may, with or without notice, appoint any suitable individual as a temporary guardian of the person for the incapacitated person for a specified period not to exceed ninety days.  A temporary guardian is entitled to the care and custody of the ward and the authority of any permanent guardian of the person previously appointed by the family court is suspended so long as a temporary guardian has authority.  A temporary guardian may be removed at any time.  A temporary guardian shall make any report the family court requires.  In other respects the provisions of this chapter concerning guardians apply to temporary guardians. [L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71]"
