[L 2006, c 182, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nRevision Note\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Enacted as an addition to chapter 708, this section is codified to this chapter pursuant to \u00a723G-15.\n\u00a0\nCross References\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Arson, see \u00a7\u00a7708-8251 to 8254.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7706-606.2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 182, Session Laws 2006, added this section, creating special sentencing considerations for arson.\u00a0 The section allows the assessment of the costs associated with putting out a fire and community service against the person who set the fire.\u00a0 The section also holds a parent or guardian of a minor who sets a brush fire liable for the cost of damages attributable to the minor.\u00a0 The legislature found that making parents and legal guardians of minor defendants liable for damages would be a strong incentive for them to take a more proactive approach in regulating the actions of their children. The section also states that a separate criminal or civil action is not prohibited.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 48-06, House Standing Committee Report No. 1124-06, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2569."
