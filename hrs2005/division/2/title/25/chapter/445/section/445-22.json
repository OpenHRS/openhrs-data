The statements, invoices, and bills of lading shall be open to inspection by any interested person upon application to the treasurer.  The sale at public auction shall be only of the stock on hand at the time of filing the statement with the treasurer, and the stock shall not be augmented or replenished in anticipation of the auction sale, or pending or during the sale.  The auction sale shall be held on successive days, Sundays and legal holidays excepted, and shall not continue for more than thirty days within the period of one year.  Failure to comply with any of the foregoing provisions shall be deemed prima facie evidence that the sale was not for the legitimate purpose of closing out the stock.\n\tFor the purposes of this chapter, the term \"public auction room\" means a place designated by a licensed auctioneer in the manner set forth in section 445-29, as the place for holding auction; provided that the treasurer of any county may give a special permit to any regularly licensed auctioneer to conduct the sale of pictures, paintings, furniture, books and bric-a- brac, or personal property under foreclosure of mortgage, at a place other than a public auction room.
