In such case the horizontal line shall follow the name of the candidates for vice president and lieutenant governor of the same political party, thereby grouping the candidates for president and vice president and governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party within the same pair of horizontal lines. \n\t(c)  Immediately to the left of (before) or to the right of (after) the candidate name or names, according to the requirements of the voting system, two vertical lines shall be ruled, so that in conjunction with the horizontal lines, a box shall be formed to the left of or to the right of the name and its equivalent, if any.\n\t(d)  In case of the candidates for president and vice president and governor and lieutenant governor of the same political party, only one box shall be formed opposite their set of names.  The boxes shall be of sufficient size to give ample room in which to designate the choice of the voter in the manner prescribed for the voting system in use.  All of the names upon a ballot shall be placed at a uniform distance from the left edge and close thereto, and shall be of uniform size and print subject to section 11-119.
