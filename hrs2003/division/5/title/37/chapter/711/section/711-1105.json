    "text": "(1)  A person commits the offense of obstructing if, having no legal privilege to do so, the person knowingly or recklessly obstructs any highway or public passage, whether alone or with others. \n\t(2)  A person in a gathering commits the offense of obstructing if the person refuses to obey a reasonable request or order by a law enforcement officer to move: \n\n\n\n\t(a)\tTo prevent obstruction of a highway or other public passage; or \n\t(b)\tTo maintain public safety by dispersing those gathered in dangerous proximity to a public hazard. \n\n\n\n\t(3)  An order to move under subsection (2)(a), addressed to a person whose speech or other lawful behavior attracts an obstructing audience, is not reasonable if the obstruction can be readily remedied by police control. \n\t(4)  A person is not guilty of violating subsection (1) solely because persons gather to hear the person speak or because the person is a member of such a gathering. \n\t(5)  Obstructing is a petty misdemeanor if the person persists in the conduct specified in subsection (1) after a warning by a law enforcement officer; otherwise it is a violation.
