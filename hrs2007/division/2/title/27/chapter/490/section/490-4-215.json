Security Nat. Bank of Sioux City, 168 Iowa 707, 712, 150 N.W. 1076, 1077 (1915); 1 Paton's Digest 1066.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(a) first recognizes and provides that payment of an item in cash by a payor bank is final payment.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Section 4-104(j) defines \"settle\" as meaning \"to pay in cash, by clearing house settlement, in a charge or credit or by remittance, or otherwise as instructed.\u00a0 A settlement may be either provisional or final;\" Subsection (1)(b) of Section 4-213 provides that an item is finally paid by a payor bank when the bank has \"settled for the item without reserving a right to revoke the settlement and without having such right under statute, clearing house rule or agreement\".\u00a0 Subsection (1)(b) provides in effect that if the payor bank finally settles for an item this constitutes final payment of the item.\u00a0 The subsection operates if nothing has occurred and no situation exists making the settlement provisional.\u00a0 If at the time of settlement the payor bank reserves a right to revoke the settlement, the settlement is provisional.\u00a0 In the alternative, if under statute, clearing house rule or agreement, a right of revocation of the settlement exists the settlement is provisional.\u00a0 Conversely, if there is an absence of a reservation of the right to revoke and also an absence of a right to revoke under statute, clearing house rule or agreement, the settlement is final and such final settlement constitutes final payment of the item.\n\u00a0 A primary example of a statutory right on the part of the payor bank to revoke a settlement is the right to revoke conferred by Section 4-301.\u00a0 The underlying theory and reason for deferred posting statutes (Section 4-301) is to require a settlement on the date of receipt of an item but to keep that settlement provisional with the right to revoke prior to the midnight deadline.\u00a0 In any case where Section 4-301 is applicable, any settlement by the payor bank is provisional solely by virtue of the statute, subsection (1)(b) of Section 4-213 does not operate and such provisional settlement does not constitute final payment of the item.\n\u00a0 A second important example of a right to revoke a settlement is that arising under clearing house rules.\u00a0 It is very common for clearing house rules to provide that items exchanged and settled for in a clearing, (e.g., before 10:00 a.m. on Monday) may be returned and the settlements revoked up to but not later than 2:00 p.m. on the same day (Monday) or under deferred posting at some hour on the next business day (e.g., 2:00 p.m. Tuesday).\u00a0 Under this type of rule the Monday morning settlement is provisional and being provisional does not constitute a final payment of the item.\n\u00a0 An example of a reservation of a right to revoke a settlement is where the payor bank is also the depositary bank and has signed a receipt or duplicate deposit ticket or has made an entry in a passbook acknowledging receipt, for credit to the account of A, of a check drawn on it by B.\u00a0 If the receipt, deposit ticket, passbook or other agreement with A is to the effect that any credit so entered is provisional and may be revoked pending the time required by the payor bank to process the item to determine if it is in good form and there are funds to cover it, such reservation or agreement keeps the receipt or credit provisional and avoids it being either final settlement or final payment.\n\u00a0 In other ways the payor bank may keep settlements provisional: by general or special agreement with the presenting party or bank; by simple reservation at the time the settlement is made; or otherwise.\u00a0 Thus a payor bank (except in the case of statutory provisions) has control whether a settlement made by it is provisional or final, by participating in general agreements or clearing house rules or by special agreement or reservation.\u00a0 If it fails to keep a settlement provisional and if no applicable statute keeps the settlement provisional, its settlement is final and, unless the item had previously been paid by one of the other methods prescribed in subsection (1), such final settlement constitutes final payment.\u00a0 In this manner payor banks may without difficulty avoid the effect of such cases as: Cohen v. First Nat. Bank of Nogales, 22 Ariz. 394, 400, 198 P. 122, 124, 15 A.L.R. 701 (1921); Briviesca v. Coronado, 19 Cal.2d 244, 120 P.2d 649 (1941); White Brokerage Co. v. Cooperman, 207 Minn. 239, 290 N.W. 790 (1940); Scotts Bluff County v. First Nat. Bank of Gering, 115 Neb. 273, 212 N.W. 617 (1927); Provident Savings Bank & Trust Co. v. Hildebrand, 49 Ohio App. 207, 196 N.E. 790, 791 (1934); Schaer v. First Nat. Bank of Brenham, 132 Tex. 499, 124 S.W.2d 108 (1939) (bill of exchange); Union State Bank of Lancaster v. Peoples State Bank of Lancaster, 192 Wis. 28, 33, 211 N.W. 931, 933 (1927); 1 Paton's Digest 1067.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 If a payor bank has not previously paid an item in cash or finally settled for it, certain internal acts or procedures will produce final payment of the item.\u00a0 Exclusive of the external acts of payment in cash or final settlement, the key point at which the decision of the bank to pay or dishonor is made is when the bookkeeper for the drawer's account determines or verifies that the check is in good form and that there are sufficient funds in the drawer's account to cover it.\u00a0 Previous steps in the processing of an item are preliminary to this vital step and in no way indicate a decision to pay.\u00a0 However, a more tangible measuring point is desirable than a mere examination of the account of the person to be charged.\u00a0 The mechanical step that usually indicates that the examination has been completed and the decision to pay has been made is the posting of the item to the account to be charged.\u00a0 Therefore, subsection (1)(c) adopts as the third measuring point the completion of the process of posting.\u00a0 The phrase \"completed the process of posting\" is used rather than simple \"posting\" because under current machine operations posting is a process and something more than simply making entries on the customer's ledger.\u00a0 Subsection (1) follows fairly closely the New York statute, 37 McKinney's Consolidated Laws of New York, Negotiable Instruments, Art. 19-A, Sec. 350-b as amended by L.1950, c. 153, Sec. 1.\u00a0 However, subsections (1)(a) and (b) furnish more precise rules for determining \"final settlement\" by the payor bank than does the New York statute in using the term \"irrevocable credit\", the definition of which is not helpful.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) covers the situation where the payor bank makes a provisional settlement for an item, which settlement becomes final at a later time by reason of the failure of the payor bank to revoke it in the time and manner permitted by statute, clearing house rule or agreement. \u00a0An example of this type of situation is the clearing house settlement referred to in Comment 4.\u00a0 In the illustration there given if the time limit for the return of items received in the Monday morning clearing is 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday and the provisional settlement has not been revoked at that time in a manner permitted by the clearing house rules, the provisional settlement made on Monday morning becomes final at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday.\u00a0 Subsection (1)(d) provides specifically that in this situation the item is finally paid at 2:00 p.m. Tuesday.\u00a0 If on the other hand a payor bank receives an item in the mail on Monday and makes some provisional settlement for the item on Monday, it has until midnight on Tuesday to return the item or give notice and revoke any settlement under Section 4-301.\u00a0 In this situation subsection (1)(d) of Section 4-213 provides that if the provisional settlement made on Monday is not revoked before midnight on Tuesday as permitted by Section 4-301, the item is finally paid at midnight on Tuesday even if the process of posting the item to the account of the drawer has not been completed at that time.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides that an item is finally paid by the payor bank when any one of the four events set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) have occurred, whichever happens first, and then provides that upon a final payment under subparagraphs (b), (c) or (d) the payor bank shall be accountable for the amount of the item.\u00a0 It is not made accountable if it has paid the item in cash because such payment is itself a sufficient accounting.\u00a0 The term \"accountable\" is used as imposing a duty to account, which duty is met if and when a settlement for the item satisfactorily clears.\u00a0 The fact that determination of the time of final payment is based exclusively upon action of the payor bank is not detrimental to the interests of owners of items or collecting banks because of the general obligations of payors to honor or dishonor and the time limits for action imposed by Sections 4-301 and 4-302.\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 Subsection (2) states the country-wide usage that when the item is finally paid by the payor bank under subsection (1) this final payment automatically without further action \"firms up\" other provisional settlements made for it.\u00a0 However, the subsection makes clear that this \"firming up\" occurs only where the settlement between the presenting and payor banks was made either through a clearing house or by debits and credits in accounts between them.\u00a0 It does not take place where the payor bank remits for the item with some form of remittance instrument.\u00a0 Further, the \"firming up\" continues only to the extent that provisional debits and credits are entered seriatim in accounts between banks which are successive to the presenting bank.\u00a0 The automatic \"firming up\" is broken at any time that any collecting bank remits for the item with a remittance draft, because final payment to the remittee then usually depends upon final payment of the remittance draft.\n\u00a0 9.\u00a0 Subsection (3) states the general rule that if a collecting bank receives settlement for an item which is or becomes final, the bank is accountable to its customer for the amount of the item.\u00a0 One means of accounting is to remit to its customer the amount it has received on the item.\u00a0 If previously it gave to its customer a provisional credit for the item in an account its receipt of final settlement for the item \"firms up\" this provisional credit and makes it final.\u00a0 When this credit given by it so becomes final, in the usual case its agency status terminates and it becomes a debtor to its customer for the amount of the item.\u00a0 See Section 4-201(1).\u00a0 If the accounting is by a remittance instrument or authorization to charge further time will usually be required to complete its accounting (Section 4-211).\n\u00a0 10.\u00a0 Subsection (4) states when certain credits given by a bank to its customer become available for withdrawal as of right.\u00a0 Subsection (4)(a) deals with the situation where a bank has given a credit (usually provisional) for an item to its customer and in turn has received a provisional settlement for the item from an intermediary or payor bank to which it has forwarded the item.\u00a0 In this situation before the provisional credit entered by the collecting bank in the account of its customer becomes available for withdrawal as of right, it is not only necessary that the provisional settlement received by the bank for the item becomes final but also that the collecting bank has a reasonable time to learn that this is so.\u00a0 Hence, subsection (4)(a) imposes both of these conditions.\u00a0 If the provisional settlement received is a provisional debit or credit in an account with the intermediary or payor bank or a remittance instrument on some bank other than the collecting bank itself, the collecting bank will usually learn that this debit or credit is final or that the remittance instrument has been paid merely by not learning the opposite within a reasonable time.\u00a0 How much time is \"reasonable\" for these purposes will of course depend on the distance the item has to travel and the number of banks through which it must pass (having in mind not only travel time by regular lines of transmission but also the successive midnight deadlines of the several banks) and other pertinent facts.\u00a0 Also, if the provisional settlement received is some form of a remittance instrument or authorization to charge, the \"reasonable\" time depends on the identity and location of the payor of the remittance instrument, the means for clearing such instrument and other pertinent facts.\n\u00a0 11.\u00a0 Subsection (4)(b) deals with the situation of a bank which is both a depositary bank and a payor bank.\u00a0 The subsection recognizes that where A and B are both customers of a depositary-payor bank and A deposits B's check on the depositary-payor in A's account on Monday, time must be allowed to permit the check under the deferred posting rules of Section 4-301 to reach the bookkeeper for B's account at some time on Tuesday, and if there are insufficient funds in B's account to reverse or charge back the provisional credit in A's account.\u00a0 Consequently this provisional credit in A's account does not become available for withdrawal as of right until the opening of business on Wednesday.\u00a0 If it is determined on Tuesday that there are insufficient funds in B's account to pay the check the credit to A's account can be reversed on Tuesday.\u00a0 On the other hand if the item is in fact paid on Tuesday, the rule of subsection (4)(b) is desirable to avoid uncertainty and possible disputes between the bank and its customer as to exactly what hour within the day the credit is available.\n\u00a0 12.\u00a0 Subsection (5) recognizes that even when A makes a deposit of cash in his account on Monday it takes some period of time to record that cash deposit and communicate it to A's bookkeeper (the bookkeeper handling A's account) so that A's bookkeeper has a record of it when she considers whether there are available funds to pay A's check.\u00a0 Where as indicated in Comment 5 A's bookkeeper is the particular employee in the bank to determine, in most cases and subject to supervisory control, whether the item may be paid, the effectiveness of a deposit of cash as a basis for paying a check must of necessity rest upon when the record of that deposit reaches such bookkeeper rather than when it passes through the teller's window.\u00a0 Consequently, although the bank is charged with responsibility for cash deposited from the moment it is received on Monday the cash is not effective as a basis for paying checks until the opening of business on Tuesday.\n\u00a0
