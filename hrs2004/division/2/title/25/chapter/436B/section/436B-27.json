The department may also seek the imposition of fines provided by subsection (a).  The plaintiff or petitioner in a suit for an injunction need not allege or prove actual damages to prevail.  Reasonable attorney fees and costs shall be allowed by the court to the plaintiff or petitioner as the prevailing party.\n\t(d)  All tools, implements, armamentariums, documents, materials, or any other property used by any person to provide professional or vocational services without a license required by law shall be declared forfeited to the State by the court and turned over to the department for disposition as it deems appropriate.
