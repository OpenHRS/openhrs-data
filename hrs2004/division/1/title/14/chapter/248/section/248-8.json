All taxes collected under chapter 243 in each calendar year, except the \"county of Hawaii fuel tax\", \"city and county of Honolulu fuel tax\", \"county of Maui fuel tax\", and \"county of Kauai fuel tax\", shall be deposited in the state highway fund; provided that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAll taxes collected under chapter 243 with respect to gasoline or other aviation fuel sold for use in or used for airplanes shall be set aside in the airport revenue fund; and\n\t(2)\tAll taxes collected under chapter 243 with respect to liquid fuel sold for use in or used for small boats shall be deposited in the boating special fund.\n\n\n\n\tAs used in this section, \"small boats\" means all vessels and other watercraft except those operated in overseas transportation beyond the State, and ocean-going tugs and dredges.  The chairperson of the board of land and natural resources, from July\u00a01, 1992, and every three years thereafter, shall establish standards or formulas that will as equitably as possible establish the total taxes collected under chapter 243 in each fiscal year that are derived from the sale of liquid fuel for use in or used for small boats.  The amount so determined shall be deposited in the boating special fund.\n\tAn amount equal to 0.3 per cent of the highway fuel tax but not more than $250,000 collected under chapter 243 shall be allocated each fiscal year to the special land and development fund for purposes of the management, maintenance, and development of trails and trail accesses under the jurisdiction of the department of land and natural resources established under section 198D-2.
