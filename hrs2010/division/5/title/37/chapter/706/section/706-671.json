[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 This section provides for a result which the Code deems fair.\u00a0 It provides that time spent in incarceration before sentence or, where a prior conviction or sentence has been vacated, before resentence be credited against the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment.\u00a0 While it is true that most felons will be paroled prior to the expiration of the maximum term authorized by statute, nevertheless this section provides for some equalization, in the remaining felony cases and in misdemeanor cases, between those defendants who obtain pre-sentence release and those who do not.\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The Legislature in enacting the Code changed 671, as set forth in the Proposed Draft, to provide that a convicted person shall receive credit for any time served in any state or local correctional facility against both the minimum and maximum term of imprisonment.\u00a0 This provides for those few instances where the Code or other statutes provide for minimum terms of imprisonment.\u00a0 Cf. \u00a7706-606, as enacted.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Imprisonment required for credit to be applied to second sentence for the same crime.\u00a0 69 H. 407, 744 P.2d 84.\n\u00a0 Imprisonment served under a previous term of probation is not required to be credited towards defendant's new term of probation.\u00a0 71 H. 73, 783 P.2d 292.\n\u00a0 Defendant was not entitled to credit for time served while on probation.\u00a0 71 H. 612, 801 P.2d 1206.\n\u00a0 No credit applied towards probation sentence for time served in a federal prison for unrelated federal offenses.\u00a0 72 H. 230, 813 P.2d 854.\n\u00a0 Where defendant was sentenced to serve six months of imprisonment as a condition of probation, the six months of imprisonment was time spent imprisoned for purposes of subsection (2); when defendant was subsequently sentenced to serve maximum term of one year of imprisonment, circuit court was required under subsection (2) to deduct the time served in prison from the maximum one-year term of imprisonment.\u00a0 78 H. 343, 893 P.2d 194.\n\u00a0 A sentence that credits a defendant with the time served for an unrelated offense is illegal because the sentencing court is not authorized by this chapter to grant such a credit.\u00a0 94 H. 250, 11 P.3d 1094.\n\u00a0 Under this section, a defendant is entitled to have presentence credit applied only once against the aggregate of defendant's consecutive sentences.\u00a0 96 H. 195, 29 P.3d 914.\n\u00a0 Defendant claiming uncredited time served in confinement under subsection (1) is entitled to prove entitlement to the credit and to subpoena relevant documents as are necessary in aid thereof.\u00a0 79 H. 175 (App.), 900 P.2d 172.\n\u00a0 Based on subsection (1) and \u00a7706-624, sentencing court would have no authority to sentence defendant to five years' probation and more than one year in prison; furthermore, the court was required to credit defendant for time already served in pre-trial detention.\u00a0 79 H. 317 (App.), 901 P.2d 1296.\n\u00a0 Defendant not entitled to credit for time served in another state where imprisonment in other state was for another crime, not for any of the crimes for which defendant was sentenced in Hawaii.\u00a0 84 H. 191 (App.), 932 P.2d 328.\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) does not afford a defendant the right to credit against the sentence imposed against him or her for the time that the defendant spent in prison, post-arrest and pre-sentence as a consequence of a different charge or conviction.\u00a0 91 H. 163 (App.), 981 P.2d 720."
