An ombudsman may be reappointed but may not serve for more than three terms.  The legislature, by two-thirds vote of the members in joint session, may remove or suspend the ombudsman from office, but only for neglect of duty, misconduct, or disability. \tNo person may serve as ombudsman within two years of the last day on which the person served as a member of the legislature, or while the person is a candidate for or holds any other state office, or while the person is engaged in any other occupation for reward or profit.  Effective January\u00a01, 1989, and January\u00a01, 1990, the salary of the ombudsman shall be $81,629 and $85,302 a year, respectively.  The salary of the ombudsman shall not be diminished during the ombudsman's term of office, unless by general law applying to all salaried officers of the State.\n\tIf the ombudsman dies, resigns, becomes ineligible to serve, or is removed or suspended from office, the first assistant to the ombudsman becomes the acting ombudsman until a new ombudsman is appointed for a full term.
