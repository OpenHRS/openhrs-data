The maximum retirement allowance for those members shall not exceed eighty per cent of the member's average final compensation.  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced in accordance with factors of actuarial equivalence adopted by the board upon the advice of the actuary; provided that no reduction shall be made if the member has at least twenty-five years of credited service as a firefighter, police officer, corrections officer, investigator of the department of the prosecuting attorney, investigator of the department of the attorney general, narcotics enforcement investigator, public safety investigations staff investigator, sewer worker, or water safety officer, of which the last five or more years prior to retirement is credited service in such capacities;\n\t(2)\tIf the member has made voluntary additional contributions for the purchase of an additional annuity and has not applied for a refund as permitted by section 88-72, the member may accept the refund at the time of retirement or, in lieu thereof, receive in addition to the retirement allowance provided in paragraph (1), an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the additional contributions with regular interest;\n\t(3)\tIf the member has credited service as a judge, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed on the following basis:\n\n\t\t(A)\tFor a member who has credited service as a judge before July 1, 1999, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of such service; and\n\t\t(B)\tFor a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 1999, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of such service.  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced in accordance with factors of actuarial equivalence adopted by the board upon the advice of the actuary; or\n\t\t(C)\tFor a judge with other credited service, as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced in accordance with factors of actuarial equivalence adopted by the board upon the advice of the actuary; or\n\t\t(D)\tFor a judge with credited service as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, as provided in paragraph (4).\n\n\t\tNo allowance shall exceed seventy-five per cent of the member's average final compensation.  If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing the annuity included in subparagraphs (A) and (B) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in the subparagraphs in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member.  The allowance for judges under this paragraph, together with the retirement allowance provided by the federal government for similar service, shall in no case exceed seventy-five per cent of the member's average final compensation; or\n\t(4)\tIf the member has credited service as an elective officer or as a legislative officer, the member's retirement allowance shall be derived by adding the allowances computed separately under subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) as follows:\n\n\t\t(A)\tIrrespective of age, for each year of credited service as an elective officer, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(1), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service; and\n\t\t(B)\tIrrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a legislative officer, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(2), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of service;\n\t\t(C)\tIf the member has credited service as a judge, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed on the following basis:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tFor a member who has credited service as a judge before July 1, 1999, irrespective of age, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of such service; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tFor a member who first earned credited service as a judge after June 30, 1999, and has attained the age of fifty-five, for each year of credited service as a judge, three and one-half per cent of the member's average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(3), in addition to an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the member's accumulated contributions allocable to the period of such service.  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced in accordance with factors of actuarial equivalence adopted by the board upon the advice of the actuary; and\n\n\t\t(D)\tFor each year of credited service not included in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C), the average final compensation as computed under section 88-81(e)(4) shall be multiplied by two per cent, two and one-half per cent, or one and one-quarter per cent, as applicable to the credited service earned as a class A, B, or C member, respectively.  If the member has not attained age fifty-five, the member's retirement allowance shall be computed as though the member had attained age fifty-five, reduced in accordance with factors of actuarial equivalence adopted by the board upon the advice of the actuary.\n\n\t\tThe total retirement allowance shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the member's highest average final compensation calculated under section 88-81(e) (1), (2), (3), or (4).  If the allowance exceeds this limit, it shall be adjusted by reducing any annuity accrued under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) and the portion of the accumulated contributions specified in these subparagraphs in excess of the requirements of the reduced annuity shall be returned to the member.  If a member has service credit as an elective officer or as a legislative officer in addition to service credit as a judge, then the retirement benefit calculation contained in this paragraph shall supersede the formula contained in paragraph (3).
