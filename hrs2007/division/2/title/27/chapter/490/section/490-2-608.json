[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-608; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 69(1)(d), (3), (4) and (5), Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Although the prior basic policy is continued, the buyer is no longer required to elect between revocation of acceptance and recovery of damages for breach.\u00a0 Both are now available to him.\u00a0 The non-alternative character of the two remedies is stressed by the terms used in the present section.\u00a0 The section no longer speaks of \"rescission,\" a term capable of ambiguous application either to transfer of title to the goods or to the contract of sale and susceptible also of confusion with cancellation for cause of an executed or executory portion of the contract.\u00a0 The remedy under this section is instead referred to simply as \"revocation of acceptance\" of goods tendered under a contract for sale and involves no suggestion of \"election\" of any sort.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Revocation of acceptance is possible only where the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of the goods to the buyer.\u00a0 For this purpose the test is not what the seller had reason to know at the time of contracting; the question is whether the non-conformity is such as will in fact cause a substantial impairment of value to the buyer though the seller had no advance knowledge as to the buyer's particular circumstances.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 \"Assurances\" by the seller under paragraph (b) of subsection (1) can rest as well in the circumstances or in the contract as in explicit language used at the time of delivery.\u00a0 The reason for recognizing such assurances is that they induce the buyer to delay discovery.\u00a0 These are the only assurances involved in paragraph (b).\u00a0 Explicit assurances may be made either in good faith or bad faith.\u00a0 In either case any remedy accorded by this Article is available to the buyer under the section on remedies for fraud.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsection (2) requires notification of revocation of acceptance within a reasonable time after discovery of the grounds for such revocation.\u00a0 Since this remedy will be generally resorted to only after attempts at adjustment have failed, the reasonable time period should extend in most cases beyond the time in which notification of breach must be given, beyond the time for discovery of non-conformity after acceptance and beyond the time for rejection after tender.\u00a0 The parties may by their agreement limit the time for notification under this section, but the same sanctions and considerations apply to such agreements as are discussed in the comment on manner and effect of rightful rejection.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The content of the notice under subsection (2) is to be determined in this case as in others by considerations of good faith, prevention of surprise, and reasonable adjustment.\u00a0 More will generally be necessary than the mere notification of breach required under the preceding section.\u00a0 On the other hand the requirements of the section on waiver of buyer's objections do not apply here.\u00a0 The fact that quick notification of trouble is desirable affords good ground for being slow to bind a buyer by his first statement.\u00a0 Following the general policy of this Article, the requirements of the content of notification are less stringent in the case of a non-merchant buyer.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Under subsection (2) the prior policy is continued of seeking substantial justice in regard to the condition of goods restored to the seller.\u00a0 Thus the buyer may not revoke his acceptance if the goods have materially deteriorated except by reason of their own defects.\u00a0 Worthless goods, however, need not be offered back and minor defects in the articles reoffered are to be disregarded.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 The policy of the section allowing partial acceptance is carried over into the present section and the buyer may revoke his acceptance, in appropriate cases, as to the entire lot or any commercial unit thereof.\n\u00a0\u00a0Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Section 2-721.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Sections 1-204, 2-602 and 2-607.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Sections 2-605 and 2-607.\n\u00a0 Point 7:\u00a0 Section 2-601.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Commercial unit\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Lot\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notifies\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Reasonable time\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0 \"Rights\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seasonably\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Did not authorize defendant to revoke acceptance of nonconforming goods where defendant prevented plaintiff's reasonable attempts to seasonably cure the nonconformity.\u00a0 10 H.
