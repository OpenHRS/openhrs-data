Each county shall provide, where available, maps of its jurisdiction detailing the four designated areas specified in this subsection.  The maps shall identify the properties situated within the four designated areas by tax map key number (zone, section, parcel) and shall be of a size sufficient to provide information necessary to serve the purposes of this section.  Each county shall provide legible copies of the maps and may charge a reasonable copying fee.\n\t(b)  When it is questionable whether residential real property lies within any of the designated areas referred to in subsection (a) due to the inherent ambiguity of boundary lines drawn on maps of large scale, the ambiguity shall be construed in favor of the seller; provided that a good faith effort has been made to determine the applicability of subsection (a) to the subject real property.\n\t(c)  Except as required under subsections (a) and (b), the seller shall have no duty to examine any public record when preparing a disclosure statement.
