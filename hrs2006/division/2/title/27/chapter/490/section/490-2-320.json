The term C. & F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (a)\u00a0\u00a0 Put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0\u00a0 Load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0\u00a0 Obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0\u00a0 Prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0\u00a0 Forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 Unless otherwise agreed the term C. & F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-320; HRS \u00a7490:2-320]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\u00a0 To make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The C.I.F. contract is not a destination but a shipment contract with risk of subsequent loss or damage to the goods passing to the buyer upon shipment if the seller has properly performed all his obligations with respect to the goods.\u00a0 Delivery to the carrier is delivery to the buyer for purposes of risk and \"title\".\u00a0 Delivery of possession of the goods is accomplished by delivery of the bill of lading, and upon tender of the required documents the buyer must pay the agreed price without awaiting the arrival of the goods and if they have been lost or damaged after proper shipment he must seek his remedy against the carrier or insurer.\u00a0 The buyer has no right of inspection prior to payment or acceptance of the documents.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The seller's obligations remain the same even though the C.I.F. term is \"used only in connection with the stated price and destination\".\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The insurance stipulated by the C.I.F. term is for the buyer's benefit, to protect him against the risk of loss or damage to the goods in transit.\u00a0 A clause in a C.I.F. contract \"insurance - for the account of sellers\" should be viewed in its ordinary mercantile meaning that the sellers must pay for the insurance and not that it is intended to run to the seller's benefit.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 A bill of lading covering the entire transportation from the port of shipment is explicitly required but the provision on this point must be read in the light of its reason to assure the buyer of as full protection as the conditions of shipment reasonably permit, remembering always that this type of contract is designed to move the goods in the channels commercially available.\u00a0 To enable the buyer to deal with the goods while they are afloat the bill of lading must be one that covers only the quantity of goods called for by the contract.\u00a0 The buyer is not required to accept his part of the goods without a bill of lading because the latter covers a larger quantity, nor is he required to accept a bill of lading for the whole quantity under a stipulation to hold the excess for the owner.\u00a0 Although the buyer is not compelled to accept either goods or documents under such circumstances he may of course claim his rights in any goods which have been identified to his contract.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The seller is given the option of paying or providing for the payment of freight.\u00a0 He has no option to ship \"freight collect\" unless the agreement so provides.\u00a0 The rule of the common law that the buyer need not pay the freight if the goods do not arrive is preserved.\n\u00a0 Unless the shipment has been sent \"freight collect\" the buyer is entitled to receive documentary evidence that he is not obligated to pay the freight; the seller is therefore required to obtain a receipt \"showing that the freight has been paid or provided for.\"\u00a0 The usual notation in the appropriate space on the bill of lading that the freight has been prepaid is a sufficient receipt, as at common law.\u00a0 The phrase \"provided for\" is intended to cover the frequent situation in which the carrier extends credit to a shipper for the freight on successive shipments and receives periodical payments of the accrued freight charges from him.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 The requirement that unless otherwise agreed the seller must procure insurance \"of a kind and on terms then current at the port for shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, sufficiently shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading\", applies to both marine and war risk insurance.\u00a0 As applied to marine insurance, it means such insurance as is usual or customary at the port for shipment with reference to the particular kind of goods involved, the character and equipment of the vessel, the route of the voyage, the port of destination and any other considerations that affect the risk.\u00a0 It is the substantial equivalent of the ordinary insurance in the particular trade and on the particular voyage and is subject to agreed specifications of type or extent of coverage.\u00a0 The language does not mean that the insurance must be adequate to cover all risks to which the goods may be subject in transit.\u00a0 There are some types of loss or damage that are not covered by the usual marine insurance and are excepted in bills of lading or in applicable statutes from the causes of loss or damage for which the carrier or the vessel is liable.\u00a0 Such risks must be borne by the buyer under this Article.\n\u00a0 Insurance secured in compliance with a C.I.F. term must cover the entire transportation of the goods to the named destination.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 An additional obligation is imposed upon the seller in requiring him to procure customary war risk insurance at the buyer's expense.\u00a0 This changes the common law on the point.\u00a0 The seller is not required to assume the risk of including in the C.I.F. price the cost of such insurance, since it often fluctuates rapidly, but is required to treat it simply as a necessary for the buyer's account.\u00a0 What war risk insurance is \"current\" or usual turns on the standard forms of policy or rider in common use.\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 The C.I.F. contract calls for insurance covering the value of the goods at the time and place of shipment and does not include any increase in market value during transit or any anticipated profit to the buyer on a sale by him.\n\u00a0 The contract contemplates that before the goods arrive at their destination they may be sold again and again on C.I.F. terms and that the original policy of insurance and bill of lading will run with the interest in the goods by being transferred to each successive buyer.\u00a0 A buyer who becomes the seller in such an intermediate contract for sale does not thereby, if his sub-buyer knows the circumstances, undertake to insure the goods again at an increased price fixed in the new contract or to cover the increase in price by additional insurance, and his buyer may not reject the documents on the ground that the original policy does not cover such higher price.\u00a0 If such a sub-buyer desires additional insurance he must procure it for himself.\n\u00a0 Where the seller exercises an option to ship \"freight collect\" and to credit the buyer with the freight against the C.I.F. price, the insurance need not cover the freight since the freight is not at the buyer's risk.\u00a0 On the other hand, where the seller prepays the freight upon shipping under a bill of lading requiring prepayment and providing that the freight shall be deemed earned and shall be retained by the carrier \"ship and/or cargo lost or not lost,\" or using words of similar import, he must procure insurance that will cover the freight, because notwithstanding that the goods are lost in transit the buyer is bound to pay the freight as part of the C.I.F. price and will be unable to recover it back from the carrier.\n\u00a0 9.\u00a0 Insurance \"for the account of whom it may concern\" is usual and sufficient.\u00a0 However, for a valid tender the policy of insurance must be one which can be disposed of together with the bill of lading and so must be \"sufficiently shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading.\"\u00a0 It must cover separately the quantity of goods called for by the buyer's contract and not merely insure his goods as part of a larger quantity in which others are interested, a case provided for in American mercantile practice by the use of negotiable certificates of insurance which are expressly authorized by this section.\u00a0 By usage these certificates are treated as the equivalent of separate policies and are good tender under C.I.F. contracts.\u00a0 The term \"certificate of insurance\", however, does not of itself include certificates or \"cover notes\" issued by the insurance broker and stating that the goods are covered by a policy.\u00a0 Their sufficiency as substitutes for policies will depend upon proof of an established usage or course of dealing.\u00a0 The present section rejects the English rule that not only brokers' certificates and \"cover notes\" but also certain forms of American insurance certificates are not the equivalent of policies and are not good tender under a C.I.F. contract.\n\u00a0 The seller's failure to tender a proper insurance document is waived if the buyer refuses to make payment on other and untenable grounds at a time when proper insurance could have been obtained and tendered by the seller if timely objection had been made.\u00a0 Even a failure to insure on shipment may be cured by seasonable tender of a policy retroactive in effect; e.g., one insuring the goods \"lost or not lost.\" The provisions of this Article on cure of improper tender and on waiver of buyer's objections by silence are applicable to insurance tenders under a C.I.F. term.\u00a0 Where there is no waiver by the buyer as described above, however, the fact that the goods arrive safely does not cure the seller's breach of his obligations to insure them and tender to the buyer a proper insurance document.\n\u00a0 10.\u00a0 The seller's invoice of the goods shipped under a C.I.F. contract is regarded as a usual and necessary document upon which reliance may properly be placed.\u00a0 It is the document which evidences points of description, quality and the like which do not readily appear in other documents.\u00a0 This Article rejects those statements to the effect that the invoice is a usual but not a necessary document under a C.I.F. term.\n\u00a0 11.\u00a0 The buyer needs all of the documents required under a C.I.F. contract, in due form and with necessary endorsements, so that before the goods arrive he may deal with them by negotiating the documents or may obtain prompt possession of the goods after their arrival.\u00a0 If the goods are lost or damaged in transit the documents are necessary to enable him promptly to assert his remedy against the carrier or insurer.\u00a0 The seller is therefore obligated to do what is mercantilely reasonable in the circumstances and should make every reasonable exertion to send forward the documents as soon as possible after the shipment.\u00a0 The requirement that the documents be forwarded with \"commercial promptness\" expresses a more urgent need for action than that suggested by the phrase \"reasonable time\".\n\u00a0 12.\u00a0 Under a C.I.F. contract the buyer, as under the common law, must pay the price upon tender of the required documents without first inspecting the goods, but his payment in these circumstances does not constitute an acceptance of the goods nor does it impair his right of subsequent inspection or his options and remedies in the case of improper delivery.\u00a0 All remedies and rights for the seller's breach are reserved to him.\u00a0 The buyer must pay before inspection and assert his remedy against the seller afterward unless the nonconformity of the goods amounts to a real failure of consideration, since the purpose of choosing this form of contract is to give the seller protection against the buyer's unjustifiable rejection of the goods at a distant port of destination which would necessitate taking possession of the goods and suing the buyer there.\n\u00a0 13.\u00a0 A valid C.I.F. contract may be made which requires part of the transportation to be made on land and part on the sea, as where the goods are to be brought by rail from an inland point to a seaport and thence transported by vessel to the named destination under a \"through\" or combination bill of lading issued by the railroad company.\u00a0 In such a case shipment by rail from the inland point within the contract period is a timely shipment notwithstanding that the loading of the goods on the vessel is delayed by causes beyond the seller's control.\n\u00a0 14.\u00a0 Although subsection (2) stating the legal effects of the C.I.F. term is an \"unless otherwise agreed\" provision, the express language used in an agreement is frequently a precautionary, fuller statement of the normal C.I.F. terms and hence not intended as a departure or variation from them.\u00a0 Moreover, the dominant outlines of the C.I.F. term are so well understood commercially that any variation should, whenever reasonably possible, be read as falling within those dominant outlines rather than as destroying the whole meaning of a term which essentially indicates a contract for proper shipment rather than one for delivery at destination.\u00a0 Particularly careful consideration is necessary before a printed form or clause is construed to mean agreement otherwise and where a C.I.F. contract is prepared on a printed form designed for some other type of contract, the C.I.F. terms must prevail over printed clauses repugnant to them.\n\u00a0 15.\u00a0 Under subsection (4) the fact that the seller knows at the time of the tender of the documents that the goods have been lost in transit does not affect his rights if he has performed his contractual obligations.\u00a0 Similarly, the seller cannot perform under a C.I.F. term by purchasing and tendering landed goods.\n\u00a0 16.\u00a0 Under the C. & F. term, as under the C.I.F. term, title and risk of loss are intended to pass to the buyer on shipment.\u00a0 A stipulation in a C. & F. contract that the seller shall effect insurance on the goods and charge the buyer with the premium (in effect that he shall act as the buyer's agent for that purpose) is entirely in keeping with the pattern.\u00a0 On the other hand, it often happens that the buyer is in a more advantageous position than the seller to effect insurance on the goods or that he has in force an \"open\" or \"floating\" policy covering all shipments made by him or to him, in either of which events the C. & F. term is adequate without mention of insurance.\n\u00a0 17. \u00a0It is to be remembered that in a French contract the term \"C.A.F.\" does not mean \"Cost and Freight\" but has exactly the same meaning as the term \"C.I.F.\" since it is merely the French equivalent of that term.\u00a0 The \"A\" does not stand for \"and\" but for \"assurance\" which means insurance.\n\u00a0 Cross
