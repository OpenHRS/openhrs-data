The arbitrator shall be bound by rules of substantive law and shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether or not set out by statute, except for provisions relating to privileged communications.  The arbitrator shall permit discovery as provided for in the Hawaii rules of civil procedure; provided that the arbitrator may restrict the scope of such discovery for good cause to avoid excessive delay and costs to the parties or the arbitrator may refer any matter involving discovery to the circuit court for disposition in accordance with the Hawaii rules of civil procedure then in effect. \t(b)  Nothing in subsection (a) shall be interpreted to mandate the arbitration of any dispute involving: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe mortgagee of a mortgage of record; \n\t(2)\tThe developer, general contractor, subcontractors, or design professionals for the project; provided that when any person exempted by this paragraph is also a stockholder, a director, or managing agent, such person, in those capacities, shall be subject to subsection (a); \n\t(3)\tActions seeking equitable relief involving threatened property damage or the health or safety of stockholders or any other person; \n\t(4)\tActions to collect assessments which are liens or subject to foreclosure; \n\t(5)\tPersonal injury claims; or\n\t(6)\tActions for amounts in excess of $2,500 against a limited-equity housing corporation, a board of directors, or one or more directors, officers, agents, employees, or other persons, if insurance coverage under a policy or policies procured by the limited-equity housing corporation or its board of directors would be unavailable because action by arbitration was pursued.
