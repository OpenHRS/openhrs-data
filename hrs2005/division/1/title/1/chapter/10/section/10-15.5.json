L 1990, c 304, \u00a7\u00a714, 16.\nNote\n  Act 304, Session Laws of Hawaii 1990, was invalidated by its own severability clause because amendments made to \u00a7\u00a710-2 and 10-13.5 by Act 304 were found to conflict with the federal Forgiveness Act (Pub. L. No. 105-66, \u00a7340, 111 Stat. at 1448); thus, \u00a714 of Act 304, codified as , is repealed."
