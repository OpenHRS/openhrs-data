Upon receipt of the application, the court shall take action to remove the restriction placed on the person's driver's license or the motor vehicle's registration and title imposed pursuant to section 291D-10.  Thereafter, the court shall determine whether good cause or excusable neglect exists for the person's failure to take action necessary to prevent entry of judgment by default.  If so, the notice of traffic infraction shall be disposed of pursuant to this chapter.  If not, the appearance bond shall be forfeited and the notice of traffic infraction shall be finally disposed.
