The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.\n\t(3)  After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods or has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (section 490:2-610), a seller who is held not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under the preceding section.
