Plaintiffs' (student's parents) motion for preliminary injunctive relief granted in part and denied in part where, among other things, (1) it was very likely that plaintiffs would prevail on merits of claim that defendants violated due process requirements when they allegedly punished student without evidence that student violated Act 90; and plaintiffs very likely to prevail on merits of claim that if student's conduct fell within Act 90, due process violated because the statute was too vague; and (2) it was very unlikely that plaintiffs would prevail on merits of claim that defendants' conduct violated equal protection clause.  84 F. Supp. 2d 1113."
