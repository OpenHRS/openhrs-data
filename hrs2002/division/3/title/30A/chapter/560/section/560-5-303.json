The person alleged to be incapacitated is entitled to be represented by an attorney, to present evidence, to cross- examine witnesses, including any person submitting a report and the family court officer or other person designated by the court to interview the person.  The issue may be determined at a closed hearing. [L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71; am L 1977, c 144, \u00a743; am L 1988, c 305, \u00a73; gen ch 1993]"
