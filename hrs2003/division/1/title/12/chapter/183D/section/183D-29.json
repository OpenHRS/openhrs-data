    "text": "(a)  The department may designate agents to collect hunting application fees and sell hunting licenses in accordance with this section.  Agents shall report all collections of application fees and sales of licenses to the department monthly and not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the month covered by the report.  Wilful failure to make a report shall be cause for cancellation of the agency and upon the cancellation a full accounting and settlement for all applications and licenses shall be made forthwith.  All fees collected including application fees shall be remitted to the department at the same time as the report of license sales is made.  If the agents prepay for the licenses, then the fees collected shall be retained by the agents, rather than remitted to the department.\n\t(b)  Agents shall receive ten per cent of the value of application fees collected and licenses sold.  All reports on application fee collections and license sales shall be made on forms supplied by the department.  The duly authorized agents of the department may administer oaths as required in license applications.  Chapter 40 shall not apply to the agents.
