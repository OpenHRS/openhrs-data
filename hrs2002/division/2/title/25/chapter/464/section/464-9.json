With each application there shall be paid to the board an application fee, the fee to be nonreturnable after the application has been entered in the records of the board.\n\tFor each examination, or repetition thereof in whole or in part as shall be limited or permitted by the rules of the board, the candidate shall pay to the board an examination fee; provided where the candidate is eligible to take only that part of the examination pertaining to engineering fundamentals the candidate shall pay the appropriate fee.  The fee paid shall not be refundable; provided if a candidate after having paid the fee is unable for any reason beyond the candidate's control to participate in the examination, the board may extend the time of the candidate's participation to the next regular examination date and credit the candidate the amount of the fee paid.\n\t(b)  Upon qualifying for licensure, the applicant shall pay a license fee, and upon receipt thereof by the board shall thereupon be licensed as a professional engineer, architect, land surveyor or landscape architect, and shall receive a certificate thereof from the board signed by the chairperson and secretary.  Every person licensed who, as an individual or as a member of a firm or corporation, conducts an office or other place of business for the practice of the profession shall display the original certificate in a conspicuous manner, in the principal office or place of business.\n\t(c)  Every license expires on April 30 of each even-numbered year following its issuance and becomes invalid after that date unless renewed.  At least one month in advance of the date of expiration of the license, a notice shall be mailed to every person licensed under this section informing them of the date of expiration and the amount required for the renewal.  Licenses that have expired for failure to pay renewal fees on or before the date required in this subsection may be restored within two years of the expiration date upon payment of a fee for each renewal.
