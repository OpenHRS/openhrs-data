[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-201; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 4, Uniform Sales Act (which was based on Section 17 of the Statute of 29 Charles II).\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Completely re-phrased; restricted to sale of goods.\u00a0 See also Sections 1-206, 8-319 and 9-203.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 The changed phraseology of this section is intended to make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The required writing need not contain all the material terms of the contract and such material terms as are stated need not be precisely stated.\u00a0 All that is required is that the writing afford a basis for believing that the offered oral evidence rests on a real transaction.\u00a0 It may be written in lead pencil on a scratch pad.\u00a0 It need not indicate which party is the buyer and which the seller.\u00a0 The only term which must appear is the quantity term which need not be accurately stated but recovery is limited to the amount stated.\u00a0 The price, time and place of payment or delivery, the general quality of the goods, or any particular warranties may all be omitted.\n\u00a0 Special emphasis must be placed on the permissibility of omitting the price term in view of the insistence of some courts on the express inclusion of this term even where the parties have contracted on the basis of a published price list.\u00a0 In many valid contracts for sale the parties do not mention the price in express terms, the buyer being bound to pay and the seller to accept a reasonable price which the trier of the fact may well be trusted to determine.\u00a0 Again, frequently the price is not mentioned since the parties have based their agreement on a price list or catalogue known to both of them and this list serves as an efficient safeguard against perjury.\u00a0 Finally, \"market\" prices and valuations that are current in the vicinity constitute a similar check.\u00a0 Thus if the price is not stated in the memorandum it can normally be supplied without danger of fraud.\u00a0 Of course if the \"price\" consists of goods rather than money the quantity of goods must be stated.\n\u00a0 Only three definite and invariable requirements as to the memorandum are made by this subsection. \u00a0First, it must evidence a contract for the sale of goods; second, it must be \"signed\", a word which includes any authentication which identifies the party to be charged; and third, it must specify a quantity.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 \"Partial performance\" as a substitute for the required memorandum can validate the contract only for the goods which have been accepted or for which payment has been made and accepted.\n\u00a0 Receipt and acceptance either of goods or of the price constitutes an unambiguous overt admission by both parties that a contract actually exists.\u00a0 If the court can make a just apportionment, therefore, the agreed price of any goods actually delivered can be recovered without a writing or, if the price has been paid, the seller can be forced to deliver an apportionable part of the goods.\u00a0 The overt actions of the parties make admissible evidence of the other terms of the contract necessary to a just apportionment.\u00a0 This is true even though the actions of the parties are not in themselves inconsistent with a different transaction such as a consignment for resale or a mere loan of money.\n\u00a0 Part performance by the buyer requires the delivery of something by him that is accepted by the seller as such performance.\u00a0 Thus, part payment may be made by money or check, accepted by the seller.\u00a0 If the agreed price consists of goods or services, then they must also have been delivered and accepted.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Between merchants, failure to answer a written confirmation of a contract within ten days of receipt is tantamount to a writing under subsection (2) and is sufficient against both parties under subsection (1).\u00a0 The only effect, however, is to take away from the party who fails to answer the defense of the Statute of Frauds; the burden of persuading the trier of fact that a contract was in fact made orally prior to the written confirmation is unaffected.\u00a0 Compare the effect of a failure to reply under Section 2-207.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Failure to satisfy the requirements of this section does not render the contract void for all purposes, but merely prevents it from being judicially enforced in favor of a party to the contract.\u00a0 For example, a buyer who takes possession of goods as provided in an oral contract which the seller has not meanwhile repudiated, is not a trespasser.\u00a0 Nor would the Statute of Frauds provisions of this section be a defense to a third person who wrongfully induces a party to refuse to perform an oral contract, even though the injured party cannot maintain an action for damages against the party so refusing to perform.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The requirement of \"signing\" is discussed in the comment to Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 It is not necessary that the writing be delivered to anybody.\u00a0 It need not be signed or authenticated by both parties but it is, of course, not sufficient against one who has not signed it.\u00a0 Prior to a dispute no one can determine which party's signing of the memorandum may be necessary but from the time of contracting each party should be aware that to him it is signing by the other which is important.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 If the making of a contract is admitted in court, either in a written pleading, by stipulation or by oral statement before the court, no additional writing is necessary for protection against fraud.\u00a0 Under this section it is no longer possible to admit the contract in court and still treat the Statute as a defense.\u00a0 However, the contract is not thus conclusively established.\u00a0 The admission so made by a party is itself evidential against him of the truth of the facts so admitted and of nothing more; as against the other party, it is not evidential at all.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 See Sections 1-201, 2-202, 2-207, 2-209 and 2-304.\n\u00a0\u00a0Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Action\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Between merchants\".\u00a0 Section 2-104.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notice\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Reasonable time\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0 \"Sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Defendant's motion to dismiss based on statute of frauds denied.\u00a0 691 F.
