In lieu of such stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request no later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.\n\t\t(B)\tThat, upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance or five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.\n\t\t(C)\tThat a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make the election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.\n\t\t(D)\tThat, if the policy has been paid-up by completion of all premium payments or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as may be hereinafter specified.\n\t\t(E)\tIn the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate, and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy.  In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.\n\t\t(F)\tA statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of the jurisdiction in which the policy is delivered; an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy; if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that the method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the jurisdiction in which the policy is delivered; and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.\n\n\t(2)\tAny of the foregoing provisions or portions thereof not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy.\n\t(3)\tThe insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  Cash surrender value - life:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAny cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection (b), shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value, on the anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits that would have been provided for by the policy including any existing paid-up additions, if there had been no default, over the sum of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsection (e) corresponding to premiums that would have fallen due on and after the anniversary; and\n\t\t(B)\tThe amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy; provided that:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tFor any policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e)(8) that provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in this paragraph shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value for a policy that provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tFor any family policy issued on or after the operative date of subsection (e)(8) that defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's seventy-first birthday, the cash surrender value referred to in this paragraph shall be an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value for a policy that provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such term insurance on the life of the spouse.\n\n\n\n\t(2)\tAny cash surrender value available within thirty days after any policy anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy including any existing paid-up additions, shall be decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  Paid-up nonforfeiture benefit - life:  Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of the anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the condition that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.\n\t(e)  The adjusted premium - life:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8) as defined therein.  Except as provided in paragraph (4), the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;\n\t\t(B)\tTwo per cent of the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as hereinafter defined, if the amount of insurance varies with duration of the policy;\n\t\t(C)\tForty per cent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year; and\n\t\t(D)\tTwenty-five per cent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.\n\n\t(2)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  In applying the percentages specified in paragraph (1)(C) and (D), no adjusted premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.  Whenever the plan or term of a policy has been changed, either by request of the insured or automatically in accordance with the policy, the date of inception of the changed policy for the purposes of determining a nonforfeiture benefit or cash surrender value shall be the date as of which the age of the insured is determined for the purposes of the changed policy.\n\t(3)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of this paragraph shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy.  In the case of a policy providing a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten was the amount provided by the policy at age ten.\n\t(4)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provision shall be equal to the adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits, increased, during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable, by the adjusted premiums for the term insurance.\n\t\t\tThe foregoing amounts in paragraph (1)(A) and (B) being calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), except that for the purposes of paragraph (1)(B), (C), and (D), the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in paragraph (1)(B) shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in paragraph (1)(A).\n\t(5)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (6) and (7), all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1941 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table; provided that for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than three years younger than the actual age of the insured, and such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.  All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half per cent a year, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\tIn calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty per cent of the rates of mortality according to the applicable table.\n\tFor insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the commissioner.\n\t(6)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1958 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table.\n\t\t\tThe rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shall not exceed three and one-half per cent a year, except that:\n\n\t\t(A)\tA rate of interest not exceeding four per cent a year may be used for policies issued after June 1, 1976, and prior to June 1, 1979;\n\t\t(B)\tA rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1979; and\n\t\t(C)\tFor any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy, a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent a year may be used.\n\n\t\t\tFor any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not more than six years younger than the actual age of the insured.\n\tIn calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1958 Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\tFor insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the commissioner.\n\t\t\tAfter June 1, 1959, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1966.  After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for such insurer), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the ordinary policies thereafter issued by such insurer.  If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such insurer shall be January 1, 1966.\n\t(7)\tThis paragraph shall not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of paragraph (8).  In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table.\n\t\t\tThe rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits shall not exceed three and one-half per cent a year, except that:\n\n\t\t(A)\tA rate of interest not exceeding four per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1976, and prior to June 1, 1979;\n\t\t(B)\tA rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent a year may be used for policies issued on or after June 1, 1979; and\n\t\t(C)\tFor any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent a year may be used.\n\tIn calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\tFor insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the commissioner.\n\t\t\t\tAfter May 8, 1965, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1968.  After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date (which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for such insurer), this paragraph shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such insurer.  If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such insurer shall be January 1, 1968.\n\t(8)\t(A)\tThis paragraph shall apply to all policies issued on or after the operative date of this paragraph.  Except as provided in subparagraph (G), the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tOne per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and\n\t\t\t(iii)\tOne hundred twenty-five per cent of the nonforfeiture net level premium as hereinafter defined.\n\n\t\t\tIn applying the percentage specified in clause (iii), no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.  The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this paragraph shall be the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.\n\t\t(B)\tThe nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of such policy on which a premium falls due.\n\t\t(C)\tIn the case of policies that cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or that provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy immediately after the change.  At the time of any such change in the benefit or premiums the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.\n\t\t(D)\tExcept as otherwise provided in subparagraph (G), the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy shall be such uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards, and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of the sum of:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.\n\n\t\t(E)\tThe additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, shall be the sum of:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tOne per cent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change, or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tOne hundred twenty-five per cent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.\n\n\t\t(F)\tThe recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium shall be equal to the result obtained by dividing the value defined in clause (i) by the value defined in clause (ii):\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the charge times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the charges on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred, plus the present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy; and\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of charge on which a premium falls due.\n\n\t\t(G)\tNotwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph to the contrary, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis that provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, such policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis that provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for such substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide such higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.\n\t\t(H)\tAll adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall:  for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of either the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, or at the election of the company for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors; for all policies of industrial insurance be calculated on the basis of the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table; and for all policies issued in a particular calendar year be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate as defined in this paragraph for policies issued in that calendar year; provided that:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tAt the option of the company, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding nonforfeiture interest rate, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tUnder any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by subsection (b), shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any;\n\t\t\t(iii)\tA company may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values;\n\t\t\t(iv)\tIn calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table for policies of industrial insurance;\n\t\t\t(v)\tFor insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the aforementioned tables;\n\t\t\t(vi)\tAny ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1980 Standard Ordinary Mortality Table with or without Ten-Year Select Mortality Factors or for the Commissioners 1980 Extended Term Insurance Table; and\n\t\t\t(vii)\tAny industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, that are approved by rule by the commissioner for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the Commissioners 1961 Standard Industrial Mortality Table or the Commissioners 1961 Industrial Extended Term Insurance Table.\n\n\t\t(I)\tThe nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the Standard Valuation Law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of one per cent.\n\t\t(J)\tNotwithstanding any other provision in this code to the contrary, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form that involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.\n\t\t(K)\tAfter the effective date of this paragraph, any company may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with this paragraph after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which shall be the operative date of this paragraph for such company.  If a company makes no such election, the operative date of this paragraph for such company shall be January 1, 1989.\n\t\t(L)\tIn the case of any plan of life insurance that provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurance company based on then estimates of future experience, or in the case of any plan of life insurance that is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e), then:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e);\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe commissioner shall be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of that plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds; and\n\t\t\t(iii)\tThe cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by such plan shall not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life Insurance, as determined by rules adopted by the commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(f)  Calculation of values - life:  Any cash surrender value and any paid-up value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary.  All values referred to in subsections (c), (d), and (e) may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death.  The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions.  Notwithstanding subsection (c), additional benefits payable:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIn the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means;\n\t(2)\tIn the event of total and permanent disability;\n\t(3)\tAs reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits;\n\t(4)\tAs term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply;\n\t(5)\tAs term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid up by reason of the death of a parent of the child; and\n\t(6)\tAs other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits, and premiums for all such additional benefits,\n\n\n\nshall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits.\n\t(g)  This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, shall apply to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1985.  Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount that does not differ by more than two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of the greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified, and the present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the company under the policy.\n\tThe basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits that would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the company, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, as hereinafter defined, corresponding to premiums that would have fallen due on and after such anniversary.  The effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection (c) or (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection (c) or (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.\n\tThe nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) or subsection (e)(8), whichever is applicable.  Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tShall be the same for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the later of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe fifth policy anniversary; and\n\t\t(B)\tThe first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance be uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years; and\n\n\t(2)\tShall be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in paragraph (1) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.\n\n\n\nNo basic cash value may be less than the value that would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) or subsection (e)(8), whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.\n\tAll adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this section.  The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.\n\tAny cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary, and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e)(8), and (f).  The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed as paragraphs (1) through (6) in subsection (f) shall conform with the principles of this subsection.\n\t(h)  Exceptions.  This section shall not apply to any of the following:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tReinsurance;\n\t(2)\tGroup insurance;\n\t(3)\tPure endowment;\n\t(4)\tAnnuity or reversionary annuity contract;\n\t(5)\tTerm policy uniform amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;\n\t(6)\tTerm policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy;\n\t(7)\tPolicy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year calculated as specified in subsections (c), (d), and (e), exceeds two and one-half per cent of the amount on insurance at the beginning of the policy year; and\n\t(8)\tPolicy which shall be delivered outside this State through a producer or other representative of the company issuing the policy.\n\n\n\n\tFor purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy shall be the age at expiry of the oldest life.\n\t(i)  Operative date.  After January 1, 1956, any insurer may file with the commissioner a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date within six months from January 1, 1956.
