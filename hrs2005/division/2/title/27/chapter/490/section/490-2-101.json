SHORT TITLE, GENERAL CONSTRUCTION AND SUBJECT MATTER\n     This Article shall be known and may be cited as Uniform Commercial Code - Sales. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-101; HRS ]\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n  This Article is a complete revision and modernization of the Uniform Sales Act which was promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1906 and has been adopted in 34 states and Alaska, the District of Columbia and Hawaii.\n  The coverage of the present Article is much more extensive than that of the old Sales Act and extends to the various bodies of case law which have been developed both outside of and under the latter.\n  The arrangement of the present Article is in terms of contract for sale and the various steps of its performance.  The legal consequences are stated as following directly from the contract and action taken under it without resorting to the idea of when property or title passed or was to pass as being the determining factor.  The purpose is to avoid making practical issues between practical men turn upon the location of an intangible something, the passing of which no man can prove by evidence and to substitute for such abstractions proof of words and actions of a tangible character."
