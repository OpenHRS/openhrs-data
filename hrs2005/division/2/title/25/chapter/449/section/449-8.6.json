The purchaser of all or substantially all of the ongoing operations of a licensee shall file an application for approval in accordance with this chapter and shall not act as an escrow depository unless it has been licensed by the commissioner.\n\t(c)  If the licensee is a corporation, any intended transfer of its voting stock which may result in the acquisition of control of the licensee may be considered a transfer of license.  Any intended transfer of the voting stock which may result in the acquisition of control shall be reported to the commissioner in writing.  Upon determination by the commissioner that the intended transfer will result in the acquisition of control, the transferee of the stock shall file an application for approval to act as an escrow depository and shall not acquire control of an escrow depository until the transferee has been approved by the commissioner.
