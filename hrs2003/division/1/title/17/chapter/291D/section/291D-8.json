Where the commission of the traffic infraction has not been established, an order dismissing the notice of traffic infraction with prejudice shall be entered in the records.  Where it has been established that the traffic infraction was committed, the court shall enter judgment for the State and may assess a monetary assessment pursuant to section 291D-9.  The court also shall inform the person of the right to request, within thirty days, a trial pursuant to section 291D-13.  If the person requests a trial at the hearing, the court shall provide the person with the trial date forthwith.  If trial is elected, arraignment and plea shall be held at the time of trial.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  In proceedings to explain mitigating circumstances:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe procedure shall be informal and shall be limited to the issue of mitigating circumstances.  A person who requests to explain the circumstances shall not be permitted to contest the issuance of the notice of traffic infraction; and\n\t(2)\tAfter the court has received the explanation, the court shall enter judgment for the State and may assess a monetary assessment, pursuant to section 291D-9; and\n\t(3)\tThe court after receiving the explanation may vacate the admission and dismiss the notice of traffic infraction with prejudice where the explanation establishes that the infraction was not committed; and\n\t(4)\tThere shall be no appeal from the order.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If a person for whom a hearing has been scheduled to contest the notice of traffic infraction or a hearing to explain mitigating circumstances fails to appear at the hearing, the court shall enter judgment by default for the State and take action as provided in section 291D-7(e).  If the monetary assessment is not paid within thirty days, the court shall take action as provided in section 291D-10. [L 1993, c 214, pt of \u00a72; am L 1997, c 60, \u00a711]"
