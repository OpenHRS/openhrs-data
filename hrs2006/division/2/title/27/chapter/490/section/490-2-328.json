[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-328; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 21, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Completely rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The auctioneer may in his discretion either reopen the bidding or close the sale on the bid on which the hammer was falling when a bid is made at that moment.\u00a0 The recognition of a bid of this kind by the auctioneer in his discretion does not mean a closing in favor of such a bidder, but only that the bid has been accepted as a continuation of the bidding.\u00a0 If recognized, such a bid discharges the bid on which the hammer was falling when it was made.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 An auction \"with reserve\" is the normal procedure.\u00a0 The crucial point, however, for determining the nature of an auction is the \"putting up\" of the goods.\u00a0 This Article accepts the view that the goods may be withdrawn before they are actually \"put up,\" regardless of whether the auction is advertised as one without reserve, without liability on the part of the auction announcer to persons who are present.\u00a0 This is subject to any peculiar facts which might bring the case within the \"firm offer\" principle of this Article, but an offer to persons generally would require unmistakable language in order to fall within that section.\u00a0 The prior announcement of the nature of the auction either as with reserve or without reserve will, however, enter as an \"explicit term\" in the \"putting up\" of the goods and conduct thereafter must be governed accordingly.\u00a0 The present section continues the prior rule permitting withdrawal of bids in auctions both with and without reserve; and the rule is made explicit that the retraction of a bid does not revive a prior bid.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Section 2-205.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Lot\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notice\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \"Thirty day money back guarantee\" did not prevent sale from constituting an auction.\u00a0 51 H. 502, 463 P.2d 914."
