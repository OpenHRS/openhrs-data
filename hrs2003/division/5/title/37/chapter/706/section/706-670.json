    "text": "(1)  Parole hearing.  A person sentenced to an indeterminate term of imprisonment shall receive an initial parole hearing at least one month before the expiration of the minimum term of imprisonment determined by the Hawaii paroling authority pursuant to section 706-669.  If parole is not granted at that time, additional hearings shall be held at twelve-month intervals or less until parole is granted or the maximum period of imprisonment expires.  The State shall have the right to be represented at the initial parole hearing and all subsequent parole hearings by the prosecuting attorney, who may present written testimony and make oral comments, and the authority shall consider the testimony and comments in reaching its decision.  The authority shall notify the appropriate prosecuting attorney of the hearing at the time the prisoner is given notice of the hearing.\n\t(2)  Parole conditions.  The authority, as a condition of parole, may impose reasonable conditions on the prisoner as provided under section 706-624.\n\t(3)  Prisoner's plan and participation.  Each prisoner shall be given reasonable notice of the prisoner's parole hearing and shall prepare a parole plan, setting forth the manner of life the prisoner intends to lead if released on parole, including specific information as to where and with whom the prisoner will reside and what occupation or employment the prisoner will follow.  The prisoner shall be paroled in the county where the prisoner had a permanent residence or occupation or employment prior to the prisoner's incarceration, unless the prisoner will reside in a county in which the population exceeds eight-hundred thousand persons; or the prisoner will be released for immediate departure from the State.  The institutional parole staff shall render reasonable aid to the prisoner in the preparation of the prisoner's plan and in securing information for submission to the authority.  In addition, the prisoner shall:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tBe permitted to consult with any persons whose assistance the prisoner reasonably desires, including the prisoner's own legal counsel, in preparing for a hearing before the authority;\n\t(b)\tBe permitted to be represented and assisted by counsel at the hearing;\n\t(c)\tHave counsel appointed to represent and assist the prisoner if the prisoner so requests and cannot afford to retain counsel; and\n\t(d)\tBe informed of the prisoner's rights as set forth in this subsection.\n\n\n\n\t(4)  Authority's decision; initial minimum term of parole.  The authority shall render its decision regarding a prisoner's release on parole within a reasonable time after the parole hearing.  A grant of parole shall not be subject to acceptance by the prisoner.  If the authority denies parole after the hearing, it shall state its reasons in writing.  A verbatim stenographic or mechanical record of the parole hearing shall be made and preserved in transcribed or untranscribed form.  The authority, in its discretion, may order a reconsideration or rehearing of the case at any time and shall provide reasonable notice of the reconsideration or rehearing to the prosecuting attorney.  If parole is granted by the authority, the authority shall set the initial minimum length of the parole term.\n\t(5)  Release upon expiration of maximum term.  If the authority fixes no earlier release date, a prisoner's release shall become mandatory at the expiration of the prisoner's maximum term of imprisonment.\n\t(6)  Sentence of imprisonment includes separate parole term.  A sentence to an indeterminate term of imprisonment under this chapter includes as a separate portion of the sentence a term of parole or of recommitment for violation of the conditions of parole.\n\t(7)  Revocation hearing.  When a parolee has been recommitted, the authority shall hold a hearing within sixty days after the parolee's return to determine whether parole should be revoked.  The parolee shall have reasonable notice of the grounds alleged for revocation of the parolee's parole.  The institutional parole staff shall render reasonable aid to the parolee in preparation for the hearing.  In addition, the parolee shall have, with respect to the revocation hearing, those rights set forth in subsection (3)(a), (3)(b), (3)(c), and (3)(d).  A record of the hearing shall be made and preserved as provided in subsection (4).\n\t(8)  Length of recommitment and reparole after revocation of parole.  If a parolee's parole is revoked, the term of further imprisonment upon such recommitment and of any subsequent reparole or recommitment under the same sentence shall be fixed by the authority but shall not exceed in aggregate length the unserved balance of the maximum term of imprisonment.\n\t(9)  Final unconditional release.  When the prisoner's maximum parole term has expired or the prisoner has been sooner discharged from parole, a prisoner shall be deemed to have served the prisoner's sentence and shall be released unconditionally.
