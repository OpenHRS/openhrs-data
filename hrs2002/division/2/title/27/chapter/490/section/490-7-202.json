If the precise amount of such advances made or of such liabilities incurred is, at the time of the issue of the receipt, unknown to the warehouseman or to his agent who issues it, a statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose thereof is sufficient.\n\n\n\n\t(3)  A warehouseman may insert in his receipt any other terms which are not contrary to the provisions of this chapter and do not impair his obligation of delivery (section 490:7-403) or his duty of care (section 490:7-204).  Any contrary provisions shall be ineffective. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a77-202; HRS ]"
