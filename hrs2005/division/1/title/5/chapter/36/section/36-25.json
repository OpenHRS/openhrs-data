The total of the transfers to the loan fund shall not exceed the sum of unissued general obligation bonds of the State as authorized by the legislature.  The general, special, or revolving funds shall be reimbursed from the proceeds of bond sales upon the eventual issuance and sale of the bonds. \t(b)  The director of finance may, in the director's discretion, require payment of interest on any moneys, including loan fund moneys, used to fund any expenditure as provided in any act of the legislature for which general obligation bonds have been authorized but unissued, the debt service of which is required to be repaid from revenues, user taxes or a combination of both, of the public undertaking, improvement or system.  Interest shall be paid by the public undertaking, improvement or system which incurred such expenditures and shall be computed on the aggregate amount of moneys used by that public undertaking, improvement or system on a monthly basis as determined and reported by the comptroller of the State; provided that the rate of interest shall not exceed that which the State could have realized if it invested the same in time certificates of deposit.  Income derived from the temporary use of moneys as provided herein shall be a realization of the general fund.  Upon the eventual issuance and sale of the bonds, debt service shall be paid by the public undertaking, improvement or system as provided by law.
