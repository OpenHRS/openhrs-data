Nothing contained in this subsection shall alter existing law with respect to tort liability of a physician licensed to practice under the laws of this State committed in the ordinary course of the physician's practice.\n\t(c)  Any person who fails to provide reasonable assistance in compliance with subsection (a) shall not be liable for any civil damages.
