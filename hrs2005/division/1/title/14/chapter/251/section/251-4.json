    "text": "(a)  On or before the last day of each calendar month, every person taxable under this chapter during the preceding calendar month shall file a sworn return with the director in such form as the director shall prescribe together with a remittance for the amount of the surcharge tax in the form required by section 251-5.  Sections 237-30 and 237-32 shall apply to returns and penalties made under this chapter to the same extent as if the sections were set forth specifically in this section. \t(b)  Notwithstanding subsection (a), the director, for good cause, may permit a person to file the person's return required under this section and make payments thereon:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tOn a quarterly basis during the calendar or fiscal year, the return and payment to be made on or before the last day of the calendar month after the close of each quarter, to wit:  for calendar year taxpayers, on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31 or, for fiscal year taxpayers, on or before the last day of the fourth month, seventh month, and tenth month following the beginning of the fiscal year and on or before the last day of the month following the close of the fiscal year; provided that the director is satisfied that the grant of the permit will not unduly jeopardize the collection of the surcharge taxes due thereon and that the person's total surcharge tax liability for the calendar or fiscal year under this chapter will not exceed $4,000; or\n\t(2)\tOn a semiannual basis during the calendar or fiscal year, the return and payment to be made by or before the last day of the calendar month after the close of each six-month period, to wit:  for calendar year taxpayers, on July 31 and January 31 or, for fiscal year taxpayers, on or before the last day of the seventh month following the beginning of the fiscal year and on or before the last day of the month following the close of the fiscal year; provided that the director is satisfied that the grant of the permit will not unduly jeopardize the collection of the surcharge taxes due thereon and that the person's total surcharge tax liability for the calendar or fiscal year under this chapter will not exceed $2,000.\n\n\n\n\tThe director, for good cause, may permit a person to make monthly payments based on the person's estimated quarterly or semiannual liability; provided that the person files a reconciliation return at the end of each quarter or at the end of each six-month period during the calendar or fiscal year, as provided in this section.\n\t(c)  If a person filing the return on a quarterly or semiannual basis, as provided in this section, becomes delinquent in either the filing of the return or the payment of the surcharge taxes due thereon, or if the liability of a person, who possesses a permit to file the return and to make payments on a semiannual basis exceeds $2,000 in surcharge taxes during the calendar year or exceeds $4,000 in surcharge taxes during the calendar year if making payments on a quarterly basis, or if the director determines that any such quarterly or semiannual filing of return would unduly jeopardize the proper administration of this chapter, including the assessment or collection of the surcharge tax, the director, at any time, may revoke a person's permit, in which case the person then shall be required to file the person's return and make payments thereon as provided in subsection (a).\n\t(d)  Section 232-2 does not apply to a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual return.
