[L 1986, c 292, pt of \u00a71; am L 1994, c 88, \u00a73]\nCase Notes\n  Summary judgment granted in favor of defendants with respect to a plaintiff's (a nonprofit corporation) claims under subsection (b); plaintiffs offered nothing to indicate that one of the defendants was hostile toward the disabled in general or those suffering with epilepsy in particular; without the evidence, plaintiffs' claim that the defendant denied the nonprofit corporation the full and equal enjoyment of a place of public accommodation because of the nonprofit corporation's association with persons known to be disabled was totally devoid of factual support.  300 F. Supp. 2d 1003."
