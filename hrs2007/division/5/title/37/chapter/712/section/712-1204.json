[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1201 TO 1204\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 These four sections deal with the non-prostitutes who derive financial gain from the work of prostitutes.\u00a0 The real danger presented by this class of people is that its members have a motive to coerce women or men into prostitution.\u00a0 Through their promotion of prostitution activities they magnify the extent to which prostitution is practiced.\u00a0 Aside from coercion into and the promotion of prostitution, these promoters often gain a vicious hold over the prostitutes under their control. \n\u00a0 Section 712-1201 defines the types of conduct which are the gravamen of the offense of promoting prostitution.\u00a0 These types of conduct are termed \"advancing prostitution\" and \"profiting from prostitution.\"\u00a0 The sections following, \u00a7\u00a7712-1202, 1203, and 1204, delineate various degrees of the offense of promoting prostitution. \n\u00a0 Promoting prostitution in the first degree, as defined by \u00a7712-1202, is the most serious offense in this trilogy.\u00a0 The aggravating circumstances are the criminal coercion of the prostitute or the young age of the prostitute.\u00a0 The offense is a class B felony. \n\u00a0 Section 712-1203, promoting prostitution in the second degree, deals with two less serious aggravating circumstances in this type of activity:\u00a0 (a) advancing or profiting by operating or owning a house of prostitution or a prostitution business or enterprise involving prostitution by two or more prostitutes, or (b) advancing or profiting from prostitution of a person less than 18 years of age.\u00a0 This section provides penalties against the \"madam\" of a house of prostitution, those persons who run and control \"call girl rings\", and lessors and owners of real property who knowingly rent or permit premises to be used for prostitution purposes.\u00a0 It also penalizes those who take under their control for prostitution purposes girls under the age of 18 years.\u00a0 Promoting prostitution in the second degree is made a class C felony. \n\u00a0 Section 712-1204 defines the offense of promoting prostitution in the third degree, that is, knowingly advancing or profiting from prostitution.\u00a0 This section strikes at the small scale promoter.\u00a0 The taxicab driver who pimps for a prostitute, the bartender who sets up customers for a prostitute, and the hotel clerk who regularly furnishes the prostitute and his or her customer with accommodations would all come within the ambit of this provision.\u00a0 Of course, if any of the aggravating attendant circumstances previously discussed exist, \u00a7\u00a7712-1202 or 1203 would apply.\u00a0 Promoting prostitution in the third degree is a misdemeanor. \n\u00a0 The previous law dealt both with the criminal coercion of a person to become a prostitute as well as what is commonly referred to as \"procuring\" a person for the practice of prostitution.[1]\u00a0 The sanction provided was roughly equivalent to a class C felony.\u00a0 These sections also consider other factors, namely the youth of the prostitute and the number of prostitutes involved in the operation.\u00a0 In addition, it provides for three degrees of the offense; the highest degree, presenting the most serious aggravations, is made a class B felony, a more severe sanction than that provided by prior law.\u00a0 The least serious case, promotion in the third degree, is a misdemeanor, the same sanction provided for what was previously termed \"soliciting.\"\u00a0 The best that can be said for the former statutes in this area is that they were inartfully drawn.\u00a0 They probably bordered on vagueness which may have been unconstitutional.\u00a0 The Code achieves greater clarity than the previous law and provides for sanctions which are more realistically addressed to the circumstances involved in the offenses. \n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7712-1201 to 1204\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 130, Session Laws 1993, amended \u00a7712-1202 to raise, from fourteen to sixteen, the age of exploited minors that would subject a perpetrator to a first degree charge for the offense of promoting prostitution.\u00a0 The act also amended \u00a7\u00a7712-1202 and 1203 to make the language in these sections gender neutral.\u00a0 The legislature found that there was a need to enlarge the scope of persons subject to increased criminal penalties for promoting teen-age prostitution.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n\u00a0\n__________\n\u00a7\u00a7712-1201 To 1204 Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7768-56. \n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 Id. \u00a7\u00a7768-53, 768-54."
