Any pupil found to be responsible for the loss, destruction, breakage, or damage of school books, which shall include library and textbooks, of equipment, or of supplies, shall make restitution to the school in any manner, including the payment by the pupil or the pupil's parents of the actual replacement costs.\n\t(b)  No pupil shall be required to make restitution in any manner unless the pupil and the pupil's parents or guardians have been notified and have been given an opportunity to be heard before the principal of the school on the charges that the pupil was responsible for the loss, destruction, breakage, or damage of school books, equipment, or supplies.\n\t(c)  If the principal, upon a hearing on the charges, has reasonable cause to believe that the pupil is responsible for the loss, destruction, breakage, or damage of school books, equipment, or supplies, the principal shall design a restitution program that shall be submitted to the pupil and the pupil's parents or guardian for agreement in writing.\n\tIf restitution is made in this fashion, then no information about the charges, the hearing, and the actions taken shall be communicated to any person not directly involved in the proceedings.\n\tIf the pupil and parent or guardian do not agree with the determination made by the principal, the principal shall report to the complex area superintendent the determination and the findings made by the principal, including all the records and documents regarding the investigation, for any further action.\n\t(d)  Notwithstanding any other provisions in this section to the contrary, the State may elect to bring any appropriate action for the recovery of all damages to school properties.
