For purposes of this section the amount of retained earnings on hand, capital and surplus shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAll loans and extensions of credit on which interest has been delinquent for one year or more, or upon which a final judgment has been unsatisfied for more than one year and interest has been delinquent for one year or more, unless and to the extent the same are well secured or in the process of collection shall have been charged down;\n\t(2)\tAll assets which the commissioner may have required to be charged down pursuant to section 412:3-109, shall have been charged down; and\n\t(3)\tAny loss sustained or charge made by a Hawaii financial institution as provided in this subsection shall be netted first against any reserve established therefor, then charged to retained earnings, then to surplus, and then to capital.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  Before making any capital distribution, each Hawaii stock financial institution, except for a nondepository financial services loan company, shall, until its capital and surplus equal at least one hundred thirty-three per cent of its initial minimum capital and surplus required under section 412:3-209, transfer to surplus from its retained earnings at least twenty-five per cent of its net profits from the preceding fiscal year.
