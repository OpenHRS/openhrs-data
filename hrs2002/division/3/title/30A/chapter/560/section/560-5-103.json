    "text": "Any person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor may perform this duty, once with respect to a minor in an amount not exceeding $1,000, by paying or delivering the money or property to, (1) the minor, if the minor is married; (2) any person having the care and custody of the minor with whom the minor resides; (3) a guardian of the person of the minor; or (4) a financial institution incident to a deposit in a federally insured savings account in the sole name of the minor and giving notice of the deposit to the minor.  This section does not apply if the person making payment or delivery has actual knowledge that a guardian of the property has been appointed or proceedings for such appointment are pending.  The persons, other than the minor or any financial institution under (4) above, receiving money or property for a minor, are obligated to apply the money to the support and education of the minor, but may not pay themselves except by way of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for goods and services necessary for the minor's support.  Any excess sums shall be preserved for future support of the minor and any balance not so used and any property received for the minor must be turned over to the minor when the minor attains majority.  Persons who pay or deliver in accordance with provisions of this section are not responsible for the proper application thereof. [L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985]"
