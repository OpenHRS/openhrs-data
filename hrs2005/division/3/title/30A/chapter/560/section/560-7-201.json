These include, but are not limited to, proceedings to: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAppoint or remove a trustee; \n\t(2)\tReview trustees' fees and to review and settle interim or final accounts; \n\t(3)\tAscertain beneficiaries, to determine any question arising in the administration or distribution of any trust including questions of construction of trust instruments, to instruct trustees, and to determine the existence or nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege, duty or right; and \n\t(4)\tRelease registration of a trust. \n\n\n\n\t(b)  Neither registration of a trust nor a proceeding under this section result in continuing supervisory proceedings.  The management and distribution of a trust estate, submission of accounts and reports to beneficiaries, payment of trustees' fees and other obligations of a trust, acceptance and change of trusteeship, and other aspects of the administration of a trust shall proceed expeditiously consistent with the terms of the trust, free of judicial intervention and without order, approval or other action of any court, subject to the jurisdiction of the court as invoked by interested persons or as otherwise exercised pursuant to law.
