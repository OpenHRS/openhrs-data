However, if the person's employer provides both workers' compensation and personal injury protection payments, the aggregate shall not exceed the person's net monthly earnings (computed by subtracting the total of federal and state income taxes and employee social security contributions from the gross monthly earnings), provided that the workers' compensation payments shall not be less than required by chapter 386; and\n\t\t(C)\tThis section shall not apply to benefits payable to a surviving spouse and any surviving dependent as provided under section 431:10C-304.\n\n\t\tIf the person does not collect such benefits under the workers' compensation laws by reason of the contest of this right to so collect by the person or organization responsible for payment thereof, the injured person, if otherwise eligible, shall, nevertheless, be entitled to receive personal injury protection benefits and, upon payment thereof, the personal injury protection insurer shall be subrogated to the injured person's rights to collect such benefits.\n\t(c)\t(1)  If a temporary substitute vehicle is made available to a customer by an auto repair shop registered with the motor vehicle repair industry board or a motor vehicle dealer licensed by the motor vehicle industry licensing board, while the shop or dealer repairs or services the customer's insured motor vehicle, the motor vehicle insurance policy of the customer's insured motor vehicle shall be primary over the policy on the temporary substitute vehicle; and\n\t(2)\tIn the event that a customer's insured motor vehicle is operated by a registered repair shop in the course of service or repair, or to verify repairs, the motor vehicle insurance policy of the registered repair shop shall be primary over the policy on the customer's insured motor vehicle.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  The following persons are not eligible to receive payment of personal injury protection benefits:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tOccupants of a motor vehicle other than the insured motor vehicle;\n\t(2)\tOperator or user of a motor vehicle engaging in criminal conduct which causes any loss; or\n\t(3)\tOperator of a motorcycle or motor scooter as defined in section 286-2.\n\n\n\nThis subsection shall not preclude recovery in other capacities under a motor vehicle insurance policy covering a vehicle which the person did not occupy at the time of the accident.

Supp. 1012.\n  Owned vehicle exclusion in policy is valid because it is consistent with section and legislative intent of no-fault law.  73 H. 552, 836 P.2d 1074."
