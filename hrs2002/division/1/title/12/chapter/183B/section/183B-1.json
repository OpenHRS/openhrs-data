Generally referred to as \"loko i`a\", the system mastered by ancient Hawaiians includes but is not limited to loko kuapa, loko umeiki, and loko pu`uone.  Loko i`a are natural or artificial enclosures; loko kuapa are enclosures built upon a reef, loko umeiki are a type of permanent fish-trap structure, and loko pu`uone are enclosed by sand.  The term does not include any fishpond designed in a manner or constructed for purposes other than those associated with traditional loko i`a management and culture. [L 1995, c 177, pt of \u00a72]"
