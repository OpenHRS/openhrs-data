    "text": "(a)  If the department believes that a person is a dependent adult and it appears probable that the dependent adult has been abused and is threatened with imminent abuse unless immediate action is taken; and the dependent adult consents, or if the dependent adult does not consent and there is probable cause to believe that the dependent adult lacks the capacity to make decisions concerning the dependent adult's person, the department shall seek an order for immediate protection in accordance with this section.\n\t(b)  A finding of probable cause may be based in whole or in part upon hearsay evidence when direct testimony is unavailable or when it is demonstrably inconvenient to summon witnesses who will be able to testify to facts from personal knowledge.\n\t(c)  Upon finding that the person is a dependent adult and that there is probable cause to believe that the dependent adult has been abused and is threatened with imminent abuse unless immediate action is taken; and the dependent adult consents, or if the dependent adult does not consent and there is probable cause to believe that the dependent adult lacks the capacity to make decisions concerning the dependent adult's person, the court shall issue an order for immediate protection.  This order may include, but is not limited to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAn authorization for the department to transport the person to an appropriate medical or care facility;\n\t(2)\tAn authorization for medical examinations;\n\t(3)\tAn authorization for emergency medical treatment; and\n\t(4)\tSuch other matters as may prevent imminent abuse, pending a hearing under section 346-232.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  The court may also make orders as may be appropriate to third persons, including temporary restraining orders, enjoining them from:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tRemoving the dependent adult from the care or custody of another;\n\t(2)\tAbusing the dependent adult;\n\t(3)\tLiving at the dependent adult's residence;\n\t(4)\tContacting the dependent adult in person or by telephone;\n\t(5)\tSelling, removing, or otherwise disposing of the dependent adult's personal property;\n\t(6)\tWithdrawing those funds from any bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or other financial institution, or from a stock account in which the dependent adult has an interest;\n\t(7)\tNegotiating any instruments payable to the dependent adult;\n\t(8)\tSelling, mortgaging, or otherwise encumbering any interest that the dependent adult has in real property;\n\t(9)\tExercising any powers on behalf of the dependent adult by representatives of the department, any court-appointed guardian or guardian ad litem or any official acting on their behalf;\n\t(10)\tEngaging in any other specified act which, based upon the facts alleged, would constitute harm or present a threat of imminent harm to the dependent adult or would cause the loss of the dependent adult's property.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  Court orders under section 346-232 and this section may be obtained upon oral or written application by the department, without notice and without a hearing.  Any oral application shall be reduced to writing within twenty-four hours.  The court may issue its order orally, provided that it shall reduce the order to writing as soon as possible thereafter and in any case not later than twenty-four hours after the court received the written application.  Certified copies of the application and order shall be personally served upon the dependent adult and any other person or entity affected by the order together with the notice of the order to show cause hearing in section 346-232.\n\t(f)  If a written order for immediate protection is issued, the department shall file a petition invoking the jurisdiction of the court under this part within twenty-four hours.
