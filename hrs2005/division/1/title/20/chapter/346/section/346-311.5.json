    "text": "The legislature finds that affordability is critical in providing Hawaii residents with access to prescription drugs.  This part is enacted by the legislature to enable the State to make prescription drugs more affordable for qualified Hawaii residents and thereby increase the overall health of Hawaii residents, promote healthy communities, and protect the public health and welfare.  The legislature also intends that the program be integrated as much as possible with other state health programs.  It is not the intention of the legislature that this law discourage employers from offering to pay, or from paying for prescription drug benefits for their employees, or that the law supplant employer-sponsored prescription drug benefits plans. [L 2004, c 47, pt of \u00a71]"
