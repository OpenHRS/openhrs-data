Supp. 3d 1116 (2015).\n\u00a0 Because Hawaii law requires every insurance policy to be subject to the general rules of contract construction, and an assignment by operation of law is merely an extension of the common law tort rule of successor liability, trial court erred in concluding that an assignment by operation of law was consistent with Hawaii's rules governing construction of insurance policies.\u00a0 117 H. 357, 183 P.3d 734 (2007).\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 451 F.
