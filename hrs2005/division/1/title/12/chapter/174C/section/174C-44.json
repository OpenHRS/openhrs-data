    "text": "In designating an area for water use regulation, the commission shall consider the following:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWhether an increase in water use or authorized planned use may cause the maximum rate of withdrawal from the ground water source to reach ninety per cent of the sustainable yield of the proposed ground water management area;\n\t(2)\tThere is an actual or threatened water quality degradation as determined by the department of health;\n\t(3)\tWhether regulation is necessary to preserve the diminishing ground water supply for future needs, as evidenced by excessively declining ground water levels;\n\t(4)\tWhether the rates, times, spatial patterns, or depths of existing withdrawals of ground water are endangering the stability or optimum development of the ground water body due to upconing or encroachment of salt water;\n\t(5)\tWhether the chloride contents of existing wells are increasing to levels which materially reduce the value of their existing uses;\n\t(6)\tWhether excessive preventable waste of ground water is occurring;\n\t(7)\tSerious disputes respecting the use of ground water resources are occurring; or\n\t(8)\tWhether water development projects that have received any federal, state, or county approval may result, in the opinion of the commission, in one of the above conditions.\n\n\n\n\tNotwithstanding an imminent designation of a ground water management area conditioned on a rise in the rate of ground water withdrawal to a level of ninety per cent of the area's sustainable yield, the commission, when such level reaches the eighty per cent level of the sustainable yield, may invite the participation of water users in the affected area to an informational hearing for the purposes of assessing the ground water situation and devising mitigative measures. [L 1987, c 45, pt of \u00a72; am L 1999, c 197, \u00a76]\nCase Notes\n\n  Commission did not err in regulating the Waiahole Ditch infrastructure as a unified system as independent designation of water management areas does not preclude consolidated regulation where a water delivery system draws water from several different water management areas and the consolidated regulation of a single diversion works comports entirely with the commission's function of comprehensive water planning and management.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409.\n  Given the undisputed direct interrelationship between the surface and ground waters in the Waiahole Ditch case, the designation of Windward Oahu as a ground water management area subjects both ground and surface water diversions from the designated area to the statutory permit requirement.  94 H. 97, 9 P.3d 409."
