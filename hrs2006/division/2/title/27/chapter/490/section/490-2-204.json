[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-204; HRS \u00a7490:2-204]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Sections 1 and 3, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0Changes:\u00a0 Completely rewritten by this and other sections of this Article.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) continues without change the basic policy of recognizing any manner of expression of agreement, oral, written or otherwise.\u00a0 The legal effect of such an agreement is, of course, qualified by other provisions of this Article.\n\u00a0 Under subsection (1) appropriate conduct by the parties may be sufficient to establish an agreement.\u00a0 Subsection (2) is directed primarily to the situation where the interchanged correspondence does not disclose the exact point at which the deal was closed, but the actions of the parties indicate that a binding obligation has been undertaken.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) states the principle as to \"open terms\" underlying later sections of the Article.\u00a0 If the parties intend to enter into a binding agreement, this subsection recognizes that agreement as valid in law, despite missing terms, if there is any reasonably certain basis for granting a remedy.\u00a0 The test is not certainty as to what the parties were to do nor as to the exact amount of damages due the plaintiff.\u00a0 Nor is the fact that one or more terms are left to be agreed upon enough of itself to defeat an otherwise adequate agreement.\u00a0 Rather, commercial standards on the point of \"indefiniteness\" are intended to be applied, this Act making provision elsewhere for missing terms needed for performance, open price, remedies and the like.\n\u00a0 The more terms the parties leave open, the less likely\u00a0 it is that they have intended to conclude a binding agreement, but their actions may be frequently conclusive on the matter despite the omissions.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Subsection (1):\u00a0 Sections 1-103, 2-201 and 2-302.\n\u00a0 Subsection (2):\u00a0 Sections 2-205 through 2-209.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3):\u00a0 See Part 3.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Agreement\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Remedy\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Term\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Agreement established by conduct.\u00a0 2 H.
