[L 1979, c 184, pt of \u00a71(2); gen ch 1993]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Not a lesser included offense of attempted extortion in the second degree.\u00a0 70 H. 456, 776 P.2d 392.\n\u00a0 The requirement of a \"true threat\" jury instruction is not limited to terroristic threatening prosecutions that are based solely upon verbal conduct, but rather applies in all such prosecutions, whether the threat is proved by evidence of verbal expression, motor behavior, or a combination thereof.\u00a0 106 H. 136, 102 P.3d 1034.\n\u00a0 Terroristic threatening in second degree can be an offense included in terroristic threatening in first degree; trial court's failure to instruct jury on the lesser included offense was not plain error, where defendant contended there was a rational basis in the record for jury to decide that, although defendant made a terroristic threat, defendant did not do so with a dangerous instrument as defined in \u00a7707-700.\u00a0 10 H. App. 584, 880 P.2d 213.\n\u00a0 Defendant's words, yelling at dirt bikers to get off defendant's land, combined with defendant's conduct of repeatedly discharging defendant's shotgun, were sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction under this section.\u00a0 106 H. 62 (App.), 101 P.3d 671.\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7707-716 AND 717\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 184, Session Laws 1979, upgraded the offense of terroristic threatening from a misdemeanor to a class C felony in four aggravated situations.\u00a0 The Legislature felt that raising the penalty would provide an incentive for vigorous prosecution and act as a deterrent against such offenses.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 673.\u00a0 For discussion of a \"common scheme\" under \u00a7707-716, see Senate Standing Committee Report No. 902.\n\u00a0 Act 131, Session Laws 1989, amended \u00a7707-716 to establish the offense of terroristic threatening of an educational worker to make our school environments safer and to better enable prosecuting attorneys to obtain convictions.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 998.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended \u00a7707-716(1) to limit the charge of terroristic threatening in the first degree against a public servant to actions arising out of the performance of the public servant's official duties.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06."
