    "text": "The court has the following powers which may be exercised directly or through a guardian of the property in respect to the estate and affairs of protected persons: \n\n\n\n\t(1)\tWhile a petition for appointment of a guardian of the property or other protective order is pending and after preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court has power to preserve and apply the property of the person to be protected as may be required for the person's benefit or the benefit of the person's dependents. \n\t(2)\tAfter hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court has all those powers over the estate and affairs of the minor which are or might be necessary for the best interests of the minor, the minor's family and members of the minor's household. \n\t(3)\tAfter hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or other protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, and subject to the limitations as to specified powers as contained in [paragraph] (4) below, the court has, for the benefit of the person and members of the person's household, all the powers over the person's estate and affairs which the person could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will.  These powers include, but are not limited to power to make gifts, to convey or release the person's contingent and expectant interests in property including marital property rights and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, to exercise or release the person's powers as trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, guardian of the property, or donee of a power of appointment, to enter into contracts, to create revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the estate which may extend beyond the person's disability or life, to exercise options of the disabled person to purchase securities or other property, to exercise the person's rights to elect options and change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies and to surrender the policies for their cash value, to exercise the person's right to an elective share in the estate of the person's deceased spouse or reciprocal beneficiary and to renounce any interest by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer. \n\t(4)\tThe court may exercise or direct the exercise of, its authority to sell, mortgage, lease or otherwise encumber the real property of the protected person, to exercise or release powers of appointment of which the protected person is donee, to renounce interests, to make gifts in trust or otherwise exceeding twenty per cent of any year's income of the estate or to change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies, only if satisfied, after a hearing preceded by notice pursuant to section 560:1-401 to the persons entitled to notice under section 560:5-405, that it is in the best interests of the protected person, and that the person either is incapable of consenting or has consented to the proposed exercise of power. \n\t(5)\tAn order made pursuant to this section determining that a basis for appointment of a guardian of the property or other protective order exists, has no effect on the capacity of the protected person.
