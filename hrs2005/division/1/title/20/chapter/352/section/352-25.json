    "text": "The director, for good reasons shown to the director's satisfaction, may furlough or parole any person committed to the director's custody.  The director shall give the court and the prosecutor's office of the appropriate county a thirty-day notice prior to discharging a committed person.  Prior court approval shall be obtained when such is specifically required in the commitment order. \tNo furlough, parole, or discharge shall be granted unless it appears to the director that there is a reasonable probability that the person will not violate the law and that the person's release is not incompatible with the welfare and safety of society.\n\tThe form of furlough or parole may include return to the person's own home, transfer to another youth correctional facility, a group home or foster home placement, or other appropriate alternative.  Nonresidential programs may be made available to selected persons on furlough such that they return to the facility during nontreatment hours.
