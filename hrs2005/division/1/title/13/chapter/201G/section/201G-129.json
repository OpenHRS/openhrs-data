Waivers may be granted only to qualified residents who have paid resident state income taxes during all years in which they occupied the dwelling, who continue to pay resident state income taxes during the waiver period, and whose inability to reside on the property does not stem from a natural disaster.  The ten-year owner-occupancy requirement shall be extended by one month for every month or fraction thereof that the owner-occupancy requirement is waived.\n\tThe corporation shall adopt rules under chapter 91 to implement the letter and spirit of this subsection and to prescribe necessary terms and conditions.  The rules shall include:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tApplication and approval procedures for the waivers;\n\t(2)\tExceptions authorized by this subsection;\n\t(3)\tThe amounts of rents that may be charged by persons allowed to rent or lease a dwelling unit; and\n\t(4)\tSchedules of fees needed to cover administrative expenses and attorneys' fees.\n\n\n\nNo qualified resident who fails to reoccupy a dwelling unit after any waiver period shall receive more than the maximum to which the person would be entitled under section 201G-127.
