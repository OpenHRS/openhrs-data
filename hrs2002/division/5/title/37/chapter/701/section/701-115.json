If such evidence is presented, then:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tIf the defense is not an affirmative defense, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the trier of fact finds that the evidence, when considered in the light of any contrary prosecution evidence, raises a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt; or\n\t(b)\tIf the defense is an affirmative defense, the defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the trier of fact finds that the evidence, when considered in light of any contrary prosecution evidence, proves by a preponderance of the evidence the specified fact or facts which negative penal liability.\n\n\n\n\t(3)  A defense is an affirmative defense if:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tIt is specifically so designated by the Code or another statute; or\n\t(b)\tIf the Code or another statute plainly requires the defendant to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence.
