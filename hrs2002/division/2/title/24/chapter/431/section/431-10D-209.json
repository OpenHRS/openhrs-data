    "text": "\u00a7431:10D-209    The lives of a group of individuals may be insured under a policy issued to an association of professional persons, which shall be deemed the policyholder, to insure members of the association for the benefit of persons other than the association or any of its officials, subject to the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe association must have been formed for purposes other than obtaining insurance and have when the policy is placed in force, a membership in the classes eligible for insurance of not less than seventy-five per cent of the number of professional persons eligible for membership in such classes.\n\t(2)\tThe members eligible for insurance under the policy shall be all of the members of the association, or all of any class or classes thereof.\n\t(3)\tThe premium for the policy shall be paid either from the association's own funds or from charges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, or from both.  No policy may be placed in force unless and until at least seventy-five per cent of the then eligible members of the association, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, have elected to be covered and have arranged for payment of their individual contributions to the association.  Except as provided in item (4), a policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members.\n\t(4)\tAn insurer may exclude or limit the coverage on any person as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.\n\t(5)\tCharges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, and the dues of the association if they include the cost of insurance, may be determined according to each attained age or in not less than four reasonably spaced attained age groups.\n\t(6)\tThe policy must cover at least twenty-five persons at date of issue.\n\t(7)\tThe amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the association.\n\t(8)\tAs used herein professional persons means persons practicing a profession requiring examination and licensing under chapters 448, 453, 464, 466, and 605.
