    "text": "Where lands are acquired by the board of land and natural resources with its own funds, it shall subdivide and develop the lands into residence lots, or dwellings and lots in a manner best designed to carry out the purposes of this chapter.  \tThe board may contract with any private developer to provide for the financing of the acquisition of lands, the subdivision and development of acquired lands, and the disposition of residence lots, or the construction of dwellings on the lots and the disposition of both.  The contracts may be entered into after published advertisement for sealed tenders, setting forth the terms of the proposed contract, including necessary plans, specifications, and time schedules.  The contract shall provide for the establishment of such sale prices of the residence lots, or dwellings and lots as will repay to the developer the amount of the actual cost or expense incurred in the acquisition and development of the land together with a reasonable developer's profit computed thereon as determined by the board.  The contract shall also provide for the sale of residence lots, or dwellings and lots only to persons entitled to purchase from the board, upon the terms and conditions provided in sections 206-9 to 206-12 with respect to sales by the board.  Every contract shall be made with the responsible bidder whose proposal complies with the requirements of the call for tenders and states the lowest rate of developer's profits; provided that the board may reject all tenders if it deems that the lowest rate of developer's profit is unreasonable.  Publication of the call for tenders shall be made by publishing a call for tenders not less than three times in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published within the State.  No more than one of these publications shall be made on any one day or on two consecutive days.  The time for opening of the tenders shall be not less than thirty days after the last publication.
