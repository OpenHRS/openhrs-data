The commission, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, after notice and hearing, may suspend or revoke any certificate or permit, in part or in whole, if the holder thereof is found to be in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter; provided that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tA motor carrier's right to engage in transportation by virtue of any certificate or permit may be suspended by the commission immediately without hearing or other proceedings upon the carrier's failure to comply, and until the carrier complies with sections 271-21(a), 271-22(a), 271-17 or Act 20, Special Session Laws of Hawaii 1977, or with any lawful order of the commission; and\n\t(2)\tThe commission shall revoke the certificate or permit of a holder that knowingly and wilfully engages the services of a driver not licensed under part XIII of chapter 286.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  Upon written request by a motor carrier and for good cause shown, the public utilities commission may place an active certificate or permit in an inactive status.  The certificate or permit may be placed on an inactive status for a period not exceeding twelve months.  Prior to the termination of the approved inactive period, the certificate or permit must be reactivated or it shall be declared abandoned and the certificate or permit revoked.  The certificate or permit may be reactivated at any time within the approved period by fulfilling the requirements for renewal, including the payment of the appropriate fees.
