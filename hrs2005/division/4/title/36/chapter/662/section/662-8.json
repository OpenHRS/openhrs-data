[L 1957, c 312, pt of \u00a71; Supp, \u00a7245A-8; HRS ]\nAttorney General Opinions\n  Implies that judgments against State not funded by agency budgets.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-8.\nCase Notes\n  Applicable to judgments against State; interest accrues from entry of final appellate judgment.  6 H. App. 70, 708 P.2d 829, aff'd, 68 H. 220, 708 P.2d 824.\n  Trial court did not err in concluding that the State was immune from paying more than four per cent per annum post-judgment interest on the plaintiffs' damages; as State appealed from trial court's judgment and thus interest began to accrue \"after the judgment on appeal\", trial court did not err in concluding that post-judgment interest on the plaintiffs' damages began to accrue on that date.  105 H. 104, 94 P.3d 659."
