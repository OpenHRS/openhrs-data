Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed to the surety by registered or certified mail at the surety's address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to the surety's address as then known to the petitioner;\n\t(4)\tOn petition of a successor guardian of the property or any interested person, a proceeding may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the guardian of the property;\n\t(5)\tThe bond of the guardian of the property is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  No proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.
