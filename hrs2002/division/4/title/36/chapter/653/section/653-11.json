But from the time of the service of the copy on the garnishee, the garnishee shall withhold from the salary, stipend, or wages, which is then or shall thereafter become due, owing or payable to the beneficiary named in the copy as follows:\n\tFive per cent of the first $100 per month, ten per cent of the next $100 per month, and twenty per cent of all sums in excess of $200 per month, or an equivalent portion of the above amount per week.\n\tThe garnishee shall continue to withhold such amount or amounts until the action against the beneficiary has been withdrawn or dismissed, or the judgment against the beneficiary therein, if any, has been fully paid, with legal interest; either of which event shall be certified by the court in or before which the action has been pending.  The amount or amounts so withheld shall be deemed sequestered in the treasury of the State, or the political or municipal subdivisions thereof from the time of the service of the copy on the garnishee; provided that no more shall be thus sequestered in advance of final judgment than shall be sufficient to meet the demand of the plaintiff in the action.  It shall be unlawful for the garnishee to draw, sign, or issue or permit or cause to be drawn, signed, or issued any warrant payable to the order of the beneficiary or to any other person designated by the beneficiary for the amount or amounts so sequestered.
