The advisory committee shall consist of three or more odd number of members appointed by the department and may advise more than one department.  The department shall have the authority to appoint members to the advisory committee and to fill any vacancies.  The members shall serve on a volunteer basis and have experience or knowledge of the effect of regulation by those departments on the formation, operation, or expansion of a small business.  No person shall serve on the small business regulatory review board and an advisory committee on small business concurrently.  The advisory committees shall not be subject to the requirements of chapter 91. \t(b)  When the agency is proposing rules that affect small business, the agency may consult with the administratively attached departmental advisory committee on small business regarding any matter related to the proposed rules prior to complying with the rulemaking requirements provided in chapter 91.  Each agency shall develop its own internal management procedures for soliciting comments during the drafting of proposed rules from affected small businesses.  The agency may develop creative procedures for the solicitation of comments from affected small businesses during the drafting or development of proposed rules.\n\t(c)  If necessary, any group or members of affected small businesses may also be consulted by the agency to formulate the relevant language, develop criteria, and provide any other expertise to ensure that the proposed rules will be drafted in a manner that will protect the public health, welfare, and safety without placing an undue and significant burden upon small business.
