The commissioner shall then issue a license to establish and maintain a Hawaii representative office to the foreign bank.\n\t(d)  Each license issued to a foreign bank to establish and maintain a Hawaii representative office shall state fully the name of the foreign bank to which the license is issued, the address or addresses at which the Hawaii representative office is to be located, and any other information as the commissioner may require.
