The escrow agent shall not disburse the purchasers' funds from the account until the commission issues an effective date for a final public report for the project.\n\t(b)  If the commission does not issue an effective date for a final public report for a project by the date on which the project's contingent final public report expires, then the developer shall promptly notify all purchasers thereof by certified mail and the developer or the purchaser, after the expiration of the contingent final public report, may rescind the purchaser's sales contract by giving written notice thereof to the other.  In the event of rescission pursuant to this subsection a purchaser shall be entitled to a prompt and full refund of the purchaser's entire deposit together with all interest earned thereon, reimbursement of any required escrow fees, and, if the developer required the purchaser to secure a financing commitment, the purchaser shall also be entitled to reimbursement by the developer of any fees the purchaser incurred in securing that financing commitment.\n\t(c)  If the commission issues an effective date for a contingent final public report for a project, the following notice shall be included in the contingent final public report and the receipt and notice required under section 514A-62(d):\n\n\"The effective date for the Developer's Contingent Final Public Report was issued before the Developer submitted to the Real Estate Commission: the executed and recorded deed or master lease for the project site; the executed construction contract for the project; the building permit; satisfactory evidence of sufficient funds to cover the total project cost; or satisfactory evidence of a performance bond issued by a surety licensed in the State of not less than one hundred per cent of the cost of construction, or such other substantially equivalent or similar instrument or security approved by the Commission.  Until the Developer submits each of the foregoing items to the Commission, all Purchaser deposits will be held by the escrow agent in a federally-insured, interest-bearing account at a bank, savings and loan association, or trust company authorized to do business in the State.  If the Developer does not submit each of the foregoing items to the Commission and the Commission does not issue an effective date for the Final Public Report before the expiration of the Contingent Final Public Report, then:\n\n\t(1)\tThe Developer will notify the Purchaser thereof by certified mail; and \n\t(2)\tEither the Developer or the Purchaser shall thereafter have the right under Hawaii law to rescind the Purchaser's sales contract.  In the event of a rescission, the Developer shall return all of the Purchaser's deposits together with all interest earned thereon, reimbursement of any required escrow fees, and, if the Developer required the Purchaser to secure a financing commitment, reimburse any fees the Purchaser incurred to secure that financing commitment.\" [L 1997, c 135, pt of \u00a72]\n\n\n\n\nCross References\n  Contingent final public report, see \u00a7514A-39.5."
