If the license is not reinstated within the twenty-four-month period, the license shall automatically expire.\n\t(d)  A licensed insurance producer who is unable to comply with license renewal procedures due to military service or an extenuating circumstance as determined by the commissioner may request a waiver of those procedures.  The producer also may request a waiver of any examination requirement or any other fine or sanction imposed for failure to comply with renewal procedures.\n\t(e)  The license shall contain the licensee's name, address, personal identification number, and the date of issuance, the lines of authority, the expiration date, and any other information the commissioner deems necessary.\n\t(f)  Licensees shall inform the commissioner by any means acceptable to the commissioner of a change of legal name or address within thirty days of the change.  Failure to timely inform the commissioner of a change of legal name or address shall result in a penalty pursuant to section 431:2-203.\n\t(g)  In order to assist in the performance of the commissioner's duties, the commissioner may contract with nongovernmental entities, including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any affiliates or subsidiaries that the National Association of Insurance Commissioners oversees, to perform any ministerial functions, including the collection of fees, related to producer licensing as agreed upon by the commissioner and the nongovernmental entity.
