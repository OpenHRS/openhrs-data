The act of dispensing a prescription drug other than a professional sample or medical oxygen contrary to this subsection shall be deemed to be an act that results in a drug being misbranded while held for sale.\n\t(b)  In addition to the requirements enumerated in subsection (a), a prescription drug shall be dispensed only:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tBy a pharmacist pursuant to a valid prescription or section 461-1;\n\t(2)\tBy a medical oxygen distributor pursuant to a prescription or certificate of medical necessity; provided that the drug to be dispensed is medical oxygen; or\n\t(3)\tBy a practitioner to an ultimate user; provided that:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe practitioner shall inform the patient, prior to dispensing any drug other than a professional sample, that the patient may have a written, orally ordered, or electronically transmitted or conveyed prescription directed to a pharmacy or a medical oxygen distributor of the patient's own choice;\n\t\t(B)\tThe practitioner shall promptly record in the practitioner's records:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe prescription in full;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe name, strength, and quantity of the drug, and specific directions for the drug's use;\n\t\t\t(iii)\tThe date the drug was dispensed; and\n\t\t\t(iv)\tThe name and address of the person for whom the drug was prescribed or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed;\n\n\t\t(C)\tThe records described in subparagraph (B) shall be subject to the inspection of the department or its agents at all times; and\n\t\t(D)\tNo undisclosed rebate, refund, commission, preference, discount, or other consideration, whether in the form of money or otherwise, has been offered to the practitioner as compensation or inducement to dispense or prescribe any specific drug in preference to other drugs that might be used for the identical therapeutic indication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(c)  A prescription may be communicated in writing, orally, or by electronic transmission, and shall include the following information:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe authorization of the practitioner noted as follows:\n\n\t\t(A)\tWritten prescriptions shall include the original signature of the practitioner;\n\t\t(B)\tOral prescriptions shall be promptly recorded by the pharmacist or medical oxygen distributor and shall include the practitioner's oral code designation; and\n\t\t(C)\tElectronic prescriptions shall be irrefutably traceable to the prescribing practitioner by a recognizable and unique practitioner identifier such as:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tA bitmap or graphic image of the prescriber's handwritten signature and the prescriber's oral code designation (or license number or other identifier if the prescriber is an out-of-state practitioner);\n\t\t\t(ii)\tAn electronic signature;\n\t\t\t(iii)\tA digital signature; or\n\t\t\t(iv)\tBy other means as approved by the director;\n\n\n\n\t(2)\tThe date of issuance;\n\t(3)\tThe practitioner's name, business telephone number, and business address, unless the practitioner is otherwise uniquely identified and the pharmacy or medical oxygen distributor dispensing the prescription has the prescriber's contact information on file accessible within the dispensing area;\n\t(4)\tThe name, strength, and quantity of the drug to be dispensed, and specific directions for the drug's use;\n\t(5)\tThe name and address of the person for whom the prescription was written or the name of the owner of the animal for which the drug was prescribed, unless the pharmacy or medical oxygen distributor dispensing the prescription has the address on file accessible within the dispensing area;\n\t(6)\tThe room number and route of administration, if the patient is in an institutional facility; and\n\t(7)\tThe number of allowable refills, if the prescription is refillable.  If the number of refills authorized by the practitioner is indicated using the terms \"as needed\" or \"prn\", the prescription may be refilled up to twelve months from the date the original prescription was written.  After the twelve-month period, the \"as needed\" or \"prn\" prescription may be refilled for a subsequent three-month period; provided:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe prescription is refilled only once during the three-month period;\n\t\t(B)\tThe refill does not exceed a thirty-day supply of the drug;\n\t\t(C)\tThe refill does not provide any amount of the drug fifteen months beyond the date the original prescription was written;\n\t\t(D)\tIn the case of medical oxygen, the duration of therapy indicated on a certificate of medical necessity shall supersede any limitations or restrictions on refilling; and\n\t\t(E)\tSubparagraphs (A) to (D) shall apply only to pharmacies and medical oxygen distributors practicing in the State.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(d)  Any prescription may be refilled by the pharmacy and a prescription for medical oxygen may be refilled by the medical oxygen distributor if that refilling is authorized by the practitioner either:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIn the original prescription; or\n\t(2)\tBy oral or electronic order, which shall be promptly recorded and filed by the receiving pharmacist or medical oxygen distributor.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  Prescription information may be transferred between pharmacies, between a pharmacy and a medical oxygen distributor, and between medical oxygen distributors for dispensing purposes; provided that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tMedical oxygen distributors may communicate or receive prescription information related only to the dispensing of medical oxygen;\n\t(2)\tThe prescription information includes all elements of subsection (c)(2) to (7) and the following:\n\n\t\t(A)\tAuthentication of the transmitting pharmacy or medical oxygen distributor who is providing the prescription information including the following:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe name of the pharmacist or medical oxygen distributor providing the information;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe name, telephone number, and address or location of the pharmacy or medical oxygen distributor firm providing the information; and\n\t\t\t(iii)\tThe serial number, prescription number, control number, or other unique identifier of the prescription record from which the information was transferred;\n\n\t\t(B)\tThe date the original prescription was issued;\n\t\t(C)\tThe date of the last refill; and\n\t\t(D)\tThe number of refills remaining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(f)  For the purposes of this section, a \"prescription drug\" is a drug intended for use by a person that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIs a habit forming drug to which section 328-15(4) applies;\n\t(2)\tBecause of its toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use, is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner; or\n\t(3)\tIs limited by an approved application under section 505 of the Federal Act, or section 328-17, to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner. \n\n\n\n\t(g)  Any drug other than medical oxygen dispensed pursuant to a prescription shall be exempt from the requirements of section 328-15 (except paragraphs (1), (9), (11), and (12), and the packaging requirements of paragraphs (7) and (8)), if the drug bears a label containing:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe name and address of the pharmacy;\n\t(2)\tThe serial number and the date of the prescription or of its filling;\n\t(3)\tThe name of the practitioner;\n\t(4)\tThe name of the patient;\n\t(5)\tThe directions for use; and\n\t(6)\tAny cautionary statements contained in the prescription.\n\n\n\nThis exemption shall not apply to any drug dispensed in the course of the conduct of a business of dispensing drugs pursuant to diagnosis by mail, or to a drug dispensed in violation of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d).\n\t(h)  The director of health, by rule, may remove drugs subject to sections 328-15(4) and 328-17 from the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) when such requirements are not necessary for the protection of the public health.  Drugs removed from the prescription requirements of the Federal Act by regulations issued thereunder may also, by rules issued by the director, be removed from the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d).\n\t(i)  A drug that is subject to subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) shall be deemed to be misbranded if, at any time prior to dispensing, its label fails to bear the statement \"Caution:  Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription\", \"Caution:  State law prohibits dispensing without prescription\", or \"Rx only\".
