    "text": "(a)  There shall be allowed to each taxpayer who is the owner, developer, or lessee of residential real property, subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, a residential construction and remodeling tax credit that shall be deductible from the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.  The amount of the tax credit claimed under this section by the taxpayer in all years for which the credit is available shall be limited to four per cent of the residential construction or remodeling costs incurred during the taxable year for which the credit is claimed; provided that the costs shall not exceed $250,000 in the aggregate for each residential unit; and that the costs are incurred before July 1, 2003. \tIn the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, trust, or association of apartment owners, the tax credit allowable is for construction or remodeling costs incurred by the entity for the taxable year.  The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.  Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).\n\tIf a deduction is taken under section 179 (with respect to election to expense depreciable business assets) of the Internal Revenue Code, no tax credit shall be allowed for that portion of the construction or remodeling cost for which the deduction is taken.\n\tThe basis of eligible property for depreciation or accelerated cost recovery system purposes for state income taxes shall be reduced by the amount of credit allowable and claimed.  In the alternative, the taxpayer shall treat the amount of the credit allowable and claimed as a taxable income item for the taxable year in which it is properly recognized under the method of accounting used to compute taxable income.\n\t(b)  The credit allowed under this section shall be claimed against the net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the tax credit is properly claimed.\n\t(c)  If the tax credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credit over liability may be used as a credit against the taxpayer's income tax liability in subsequent years until exhausted.  All claims, including amended claims, for a tax credit under this section shall be filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.  Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit. \t(d)  The director of taxation shall prepare any forms that may be necessary to claim a credit under this section.  The director may also require the taxpayer to furnish information to ascertain the validity of the claim for credit made under this section and may adopt rules necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 91.\n\t(e)  The tax credit allowed under this section shall be available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000, and shall not be available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003.\n\t(f)  To qualify for the income tax credit, the taxpayer shall be in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and county statutes, rules, and regulations.\n\t(g)  As used in this section:\n\t\"Construction or remodeling cost\" means any costs incurred after December 31, 2000, for plans, design, construction, and equipment that is permanently affixed to the building or structure related to new construction, alterations, or modifications to a residential apartment unit or house, and shall not include any costs for which another credit was claimed under this chapter.\n\t\"Net income tax liability\" means income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter. [L Sp 2001 3d, c 10, \u00a71; am L 2002, c 174, \u00a72]\nNote\n  The 2002 amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001.  L 2002, c 174, \u00a74."
