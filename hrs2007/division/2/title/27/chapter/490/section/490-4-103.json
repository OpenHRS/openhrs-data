Bank of Denver v. Federal Reserve Bank, 6 F.2d 339 (8th Cir. 1925) (deposit slip); Jefferson County Bldg. Ass'n v. Southern Bank & Trust Co., 225 Ala. 25, 142 So. 66 (1932); (signature card and deposit slip); Semingson v. Stock Yards Nat. Bank, 162 Minn. 424, 203 N.W. 412 (1925) (passbook); Farmers State Bank v.

Malloy, 264 U.S. 160, at 167, 44 S.Ct. 296, at 298, 68 L.Ed. 617, 31 A.L.R. 1261 (1924).\n\u00a0 To meet this problem subsection (2) provides that official or quasi-official rules of collection, that is Federal Reserve regulations and operating letters, clearing house rules, and the like, have the effect of agreements under subsection (1), whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled.\u00a0 Consequently, such official or quasi-official rules may, standing by themselves but subject to the good faith and ordinary care limitations, vary the effect of the provisions of Article 4.\n\u00a0 Federal Reserve regulations.\u00a0 Various sections of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7221 et seq.) authorize the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to direct the Federal Reserve banks to exercise bank collection functions.\u00a0 For example, Section 16 (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7248(o)) authorizes the Board to require each Federal Reserve bank to exercise the functions of a clearing house for its members and Section 13 (12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7342) authorizes each Federal Reserve bank to receive deposits from non-member banks solely for the purposes of exchange or of collection.\u00a0 Under this statutory authorization the Board has issued Regulation J (Check Clearing and Collection), which has been infrequently amended over the many years during which it has been in force.\u00a0 (Regulation G, issued under comparable statutory authority, covers the handling of \"non-cash items\").\u00a0 Where regulations issued by the Board in pursuance of its statutory mandate may be said to have some force of law and constitute an effective means of maintaining flexibility, it is appropriate to provide that such regulations may vary this Article even though not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled.\n\u00a0 Federal Reserve operating letters.\u00a0 The regulations of the Federal Reserve Board authorize the Federal Reserve banks to promulgate rules covering operating details.\u00a0 Regulation J, for example, provides that each bank may promulgate rules \"not inconsistent with the terms of the law or of this regulation governing the sorting, listing, packaging and transmission of items and other details of its check clearing and collection operation.\u00a0 Such rules...shall be set forth...in...letters of instructions to...member and non-member clearing banks.\"\u00a0 The term \"operating letters\" means these \"letters of instructions\", sometimes called \"operating circulars\", issued by the Federal Reserve banks under appropriate regulation of the Board.\u00a0 This Article recognizes such \"operating letters\" issued pursuant to the regulations and concerned with operating details as appropriate means, within their proper sphere, to vary the effect of the Article.\n\u00a0 Clearing House Rules.\u00a0 Local clearing houses have long issued rules governing the details of clearing; hours of clearing, media of remittance, time for return of mis-sent items and the like.\u00a0 The case law has recognized such rules, within their proper sphere, as binding on affected parties and as appropriate sources for the courts to look to in filling out details of bank collection law.\u00a0 Subsection (2) in recognizing clearing house rules as a means of preserving flexibility continues the sensible approach indicated in the cases.\u00a0 Included in the term \"clearing houses\" are county and regional clearing houses as well as those within a single city or town.\u00a0 There is, of course, no intention of authorizing a local clearing house or a group of clearing houses to rewrite the basic law generally.\u00a0 The term \"clearing house rules\" should be understood in the light of functions the clearing houses have exercised in the past.\n\u00a0 And the like.\u00a0 This phrase is to be construed in the light of the foregoing.\u00a0 \"Federal Reserve regulations and operating letters\" cover rules and regulations issued by public or quasi-public agencies under statutory authority.\u00a0 \"Clearing house rules\" cover rules issued by a group of banks which have associated themselves to perform through a clearing house some of their collection, payment and clearing functions.\u00a0 Other such agencies or associations may be established in the future whose rules and regulations could be appropriately looked on as constituting means of avoiding absolute statutory rigidity.\u00a0 The phrase \"and the like\" leaves open such possibilities of future development.\u00a0 An agreement between a number of banks or even all the banks in an area simply because they are banks, would not of itself, by virtue of the phrase \"and the like,\" meet the purposes and objectives of subsection (2).\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Under this Article banks come under the general obligations of the use of good faith and the exercise of ordinary care.\u00a0 \"Good faith\" is defined in this Act (Section 1-201(19)) as \"honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction concerned.\"\u00a0 The term \"ordinary care\" is not defined and is here used with its normal tort meaning and not in any special sense relating to bank collections.\u00a0 No attempt is made in the Article to define in toto what constitutes ordinary care or lack of it.\u00a0 Section 4-202 states respects in which collecting banks must use ordinary care.\u00a0 Subsection (3) of 4-103 provides that action or non-action approved by the Article or pursuant to Federal Reserve regulations or operating letters constitutes the exercise of ordinary care.\u00a0 Where Federal Reserve regulations and operating letters are issued pursuant to statutory mandate as indicated above, they constitute an affirmative standard of ordinary care equally with the provisions of Article 4 itself.\n\u00a0 Subsection (3) further provides that, absent special instructions, action or non-action consistent with clearing house rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by the Article, prima facie constitutes the exercise of ordinary care.\u00a0 Clearing house rules and the phrase \"and the like\" have the significance set forth above in these Comments. The term \"general banking usage\" is not defined but should be taken to mean a general usage common to banks in the area concerned.\u00a0 See Section 1-205(2).\u00a0 Where the adjective \"general\" is used, the intention is to require a usage broader than a mere practice between two or three banks but it is not intended to require anything as broad as a country-wide usage.\u00a0 A usage followed generally throughout a state, a substantial portion of a state, a metropolitan area or the like would certainly be sufficient.\u00a0 Consistently with the principle of Section 1-205(3), action or non-action consistent with clearing house rules or the like or with such banking usages prima facie constitutes the exercise of ordinary care.\u00a0 However, the phrase \"in the absence of special instructions\" affords owners of items an opportunity to prescribe other standards and where there may be no direct supervision or control of clearing houses or banking usages by official supervisory authorities, the confirmation of ordinary care by compliance with these standards is prima facie only, thus conferring on the courts the ultimate power to determine ordinary care in any case where it should appear desirable to do so.\u00a0 The prima facie rule does, however, impose on the party contesting the standards to establish that they are unreasonable, arbitrary or unfair.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Subsection (4), in line with the flexible approach required for the bank collection process is designed to make clear that a novel procedure adopted by a bank is not to be considered unreasonable merely because that procedure is not specifically contemplated by this Article or by agreement, or because it has not yet been generally accepted as a bank usage. \u00a0Changing conditions constantly call for new procedures and someone has to use the new procedure first.\u00a0 If such a procedure when called in question is found to be reasonable under the circumstances, provided, of course, that it is not inconsistent with any provision of the Article or other law or agreement, the bank which has followed the new procedure should not be found to have failed in the exercise of ordinary care.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Subsection (5) sets forth a rule for determining the measure of damages which, under subsection (1), cannot be limited by agreement.\u00a0 In the absence of bad faith the maximum recovery is the amount of the item concerned.\u00a0 When it is established that some part or all of the item could not have been collected even by the use of ordinary care the recovery is reduced by the amount which would have been in any event uncollectible.\u00a0 This limitation on recovery follows the case law.\u00a0 Finally, when bad faith is established the rule opens to allow the recovery of other damages, whose \"proximateness\" is to be tested by the ordinary rules applied in comparable cases.\u00a0 Of course, it continues to be as necessary under subsection (5) as it has been under ordinary common law principles that, before the damage rule of the subsection becomes operative, liability of the bank and some loss to the customer or owner must be established.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 1-102(3), 1-203, 1-205 and 4-202.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Usage\".\u00a0 Section 1-205."
