PERJURY AND RELATED OFFENSES\n\n     (1)  A person commits the offense of perjury if in any official proceeding the person makes, under an oath required or authorized by law, a false statement which the person does not believe to be true. \n\t(2)  No person shall be convicted under this section unless the court rules that the false statement is a \"materially false statement\" as defined by section 710-1000(9).  It is not a defense that the declarant mistakenly believed the false statement to be immaterial. \n\t(3)  Perjury is a class C felony. [L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]"
