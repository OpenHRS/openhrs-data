    "text": "The director of labor and industrial relations shall have original jurisdiction over all controversies and disputes over employment and coverage under this chapter.  Except in cases where services are specifically and expressly excluded from \"employment\" under section 386-1, it shall be presumed that coverage applies unless the party seeking exclusion is able to establish under both the control test and the relative nature of the work test that coverage is not appropriate under this chapter.  There shall be a right of appeal from decisions of the director to the appellate board and thence to the supreme court. [L 1996, c 94, \u00a71]"
