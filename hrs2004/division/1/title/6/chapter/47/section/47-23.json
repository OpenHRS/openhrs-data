    "text": "In case of successive actions being so brought against the same county defendant, precedence shall be given by the garnishee to that in which process is first served on the garnishee; and if two or more processes are simultaneously served, precedence shall be given in the order of the priority of their issuance by the courts issuing them.  This order of precedence shall not be disturbed by the fact of a posterior action being carried to final judgment earlier than its anterior in time of service on the garnishee.  All amounts held on account of the anterior action shall be held until the final determination thereof, and then applied in payment of the judgment therein.  In case the amounts shall not be sufficient fully to satisfy the judgment, then all judgments obtained in posterior actions shall be again postponed to that in the anterior action until it is satisfied. [L 1989, c 80, pt of \u00a72]"
