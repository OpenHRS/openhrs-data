    "text": "(1)  A person commits the offense of fraudulent encoding of a credit card if, with the intent to defraud the issuer, or another person or organization providing money, goods, services or anything else of value, the person:\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tIntentionally changes, alters, erases, adds, creates, tampers with, or manipulates a credit card number by encoding credit card numbers onto the magnetic strip of the credit card;\n\t(b)\tKnowingly uses, utters, or offers a credit card with changed, altered, erased, added, tampered with, or manipulated magnetically or electronically encoded credit numbers on the magnetic strip of a credit card for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services, or anything else of value; or\n\t(c)\tKnowingly sells, or distributes any credit card with changed, altered, erased, added, tampered with, or manipulated magnetically or electronically encoded credit card numbers on the magnetic strip of the credit card.\n\n\n\n\t(2)  Fraudulent encoding of a credit card is a class B felony. [L 1993, c 287, \u00a72]\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  Act 287, Session Laws 1993, added this section to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card.  The legislature found that criminal elements are now capable of changing the magnetic encoding on a credit card to match a usable code and then use the card without detection, resulting in tremendous potential loss to the State's commerce.  The legislature further found that because this type of crime is more serious and sophisticated than simple credit card fraud or simple theft and the potential for economic loss is so great, classification of this offense as a class B felony is appropriate.  Conference Committee Report No. 102."
