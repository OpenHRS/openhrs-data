[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1986, c 314, \u00a77; am L 1993, c 87, \u00a71; am L 1997, c 306, \u00a72; am L 2006, c 230, \u00a77]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (1) provides that following a determination of the defendant's unfitness to be proceeded against, the defendant shall be committed to the custody of the director of health or placed on conditional release for the duration of the defendant's unfitness.\n\u00a0 The commitment or conditional release of the unfit defendant does not terminate until a determination by the court, after a hearing if one is requested, that the defendant is fit to be proceeded against.\u00a0 Upon such a determination, the penal proceedings resume unless the court finds that such resumption would be unjust.\u00a0 This section is designed to allow no hiatus in the procedure.\n\u00a0 The Code, in its treatment of a defendant committed because of unfitness to proceed, conforms to the present Hawaii law which insures that a defendant so committed will remain in the custody of the director of health until the defendant has regained fitness.[1]\u00a0 Previous Hawaii law had no provision for conditional release of unfit defendants.\n\u00a0 The second sentence of subsection (2) follows the suggestion of the Model Penal Code[2] and permits \"the court to dismiss the prosecution if because of lapse of time it would be unjust to continue.\"[3]\u00a0 Under the prior law the power to dismiss the prosecution was vested in the prosecutor's discretion to enter a nolle prosequi.\u00a0 The Code accepts the position that\nthere is value... in vesting such a power in the Court, to be exercised either where because of the lapse of time a defendant is unable to produce certain witnesses or other evidence once available which is essential to his defense, or where because of the length of the intervening period which he has spent in a mental institution subsequent to the alleged wrongful conduct it seems unjust to subject him to trial and punishment.[4]\n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 314, Session Laws 1986, added subsection (3), which implements the holding in State v. Raitz, 63 Haw. 64 (1980).\u00a0 In Raitz, the court held that when a defendant is unlikely to become fit to proceed, due process requires that:\u00a0 (1) following commitment, there should be a timely determination of the likelihood of the defendant regaining fitness; and (2) if the court determines that the defendant will probably remain unfit, the defendant should be released or civilly committed.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n\u00a0 Act 87, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to require the court to appoint a panel of three qualified examiners to report on whether a defendant who has been conditionally released presents a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.\u00a0 If the court determines that the defendant probably will remain unfit to proceed, it may dismiss the charge against the defendant or subject the defendant to involuntary civil commitment procedures.\u00a0 In addition, this act allows the court, following the commitment of a defendant, to appoint a panel of three qualified examiners to report on the defendant's likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 185, Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 1061 and 1263.\n\u00a0 Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended subsections (3) and (4) to allow mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than three examiners in nonfelony cases, and to require three examiners in felony cases.\u00a0 The amendment streamlines the process for committing and releasing mentally incompetent defendants.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 64.\n\u00a0 Act 230, Session Laws 2006, amended this section to, among other things, clarify that when a defendant is found to be affected by a physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect and therefore remains unfit to proceed, the defendant may be committed to the custody of the director of health for placement in an appropriate institution, but only subject to the law governing involuntary civil commitment.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 665-06.\n\u00a0\nLaw Journals and Reviews\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Comments and Questions About Mental Health Law in Hawaii.\u00a0 13 HBJ No. 4 Winter 1978, pg. 14.\n\u00a0 Risky Business:\u00a0 Assessing Dangerousness in Hawai`i.\u00a0 24 UH L.
