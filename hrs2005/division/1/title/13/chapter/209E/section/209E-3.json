The criteria shall be the minimum required for implementation of the purpose of this chapter; \n\t(2)\tTo monitor the implementation and operation of this chapter; \n\t(3)\tTo conduct a continuing evaluation program of enterprise zones; \n\t(4)\tTo assist counties in obtaining the reduction of rules within enterprise zones; \n\t(5)\tTo submit annual reports evaluating the effectiveness of the program and any recommendations for legislation to the governor; \n\t(6)\tTo administer and enforce the rules adopted by the department; and \n\t(7)\tTo administer this chapter in such a manner that the area to be designated as an enterprise zone will most benefit the area and the State. [L 1986, c 78, pt of \u00a71]\n\n\n\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n  Department promulgated rules requiring initial survey and annual report from the participating county pursuant to its duty under paragraph (3).  If extending survey and reporting requirements to new enterprise zone (EZ) created by the legislature would result in an increase in the level of service under city and county's existing program, then, unless department was willing to share in the cost, city and county was not required to submit initial survey or annual report on new EZ.  Att. Gen. Op. 98-1."
