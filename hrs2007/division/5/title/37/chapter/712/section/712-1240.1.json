[L 1977, c 137, \u00a71; am L 2000, c 228, \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 137, Session Laws 1977, added this section to provide a defense for the lawful possession or distribution of drugs by authorized persons.\u00a0 In enacting the section, the legislature found that the law as then worded made any possession or distribution of drugs criminal.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1127, House Standing Committee Report No. 683.\n\u00a0 Act 228, Session Laws 2000, in permitting the medical use of marijuana by persons with certain medical conditions, amended this section to include an affirmative defense for the medical use of marijuana.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2760.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Legislature intended section as a defense rather than element of an offense.\u00a0 64 H. 568, 645 P.2d 308.\n\u00a0 As California statute did not authorize defendant to possess or cultivate fifty or more marijuana plants in violation of \u00a7712-1249.5, trial court did not err in concluding that this section was inapplicable to the case and the documents submitted in support of defendant's motion to dismiss were not clearly exculpatory; thus, trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss.\u00a0 108 H. 169, 118 P.3d 652."
