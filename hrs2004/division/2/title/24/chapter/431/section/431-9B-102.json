Any such license issued to a firm or association will authorize all the members of that firm or association and any designated employees to act as reinsurance intermediaries under the license, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto.  Any such license issued to a corporation shall authorize all of the officers, and any designated employees and directors thereof to act as reinsurance intermediaries on behalf of the corporation, and all those persons shall be named in the application and any supplements thereto.\n\t(2)\tIf the applicant for a reinsurance intermediary license is a nonresident, the applicant, as a condition precedent to receiving or holding a license, shall designate the commissioner as agent for service of process in the manner, and with the same legal effect, provided for by this article for service of process upon unauthorized insurers; and also shall furnish the commissioner with the name and address of a resident of this State upon whom notices or orders of the commissioner or process affecting the nonresident reinsurance intermediary may be served.

Upon written request therefor, the commissioner shall furnish a summary of the basis for refusal to issue a license, which document shall be privileged and not subject to disclosure pursuant to chapter 92F.\n\t(f)  Licensed attorneys at law of this State when acting in their professional capacity as such shall be exempt from this section.
