The clerk shall transmit to the office of the chief election officer the state candidate's declaration of candidacy without delay.  However, if a special primary or special election is to be held by a county and the county charter requires that the council shall issue a proclamation calling for the election to be held within a specified period of time, and if that requirement would not allow the filing of nomination papers with the appropriate office by the sixtieth calendar day prior to the day for holding the special primary or special election, the council shall establish the deadline for the filing of nomination papers in the proclamation calling for the election; and\n\t(2)\tFor the board of trustees for the office of Hawaiian affairs, nomination papers shall be filed with the chief election officer, not later than 4:30 p.m. on the sixtieth calendar day prior to the primary election referred to in paragraph (1); provided that if that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, then not later than 4:30 p.m. on the first working day immediately preceding.\n\t[(b)]\tIf after the close of filing there are no candidates who have filed nomination papers for an elective office for the primary, special primary, or any special election held in conjunction with the primary election, the chief election officer or clerk, in the case of a county election, shall accept nomination papers for that office not later than 4:30 p.m. on the fiftieth day prior to the primary, special primary, or special election.\n\t[(c)]\tThere shall be deposited with each nomination paper a filing fee on account of the expenses attending the holding of the primary, special primary, or special election which shall be paid into the treasury of the State, or county, as the case may be, as a realization:\n\t(1)\tFor United States senators and United States representatives--$75;\n\t(2)\tFor governor and lieutenant governor--$750;\n\t(3)\tFor mayor--$500; and\n\t(4)\tFor all other offices--$250.\n\t[(d)]\tUpon the receipt by the chief election officer or the clerk of the nomination paper of a candidate, the day, hour, and minute when it was received shall be endorsed thereon.\n\t[(e)]\tUpon the showing of a certified copy of an affidavit which has been filed with the campaign spending commission pursuant to section 11-208 by a candidate who has voluntarily agreed to abide by spending limits, the chief election officer or clerk shall discount the filing fee of the candidate by the following amounts:\n\t(1)\tFor the office of governor and lieutenant governor--$675;\n\t(2)\tFor the office of mayor--$450; and\n\t(3)\tFor all other offices--$225.\n\t[(f)]\tThe chief election officer or clerk shall waive the filing fee in the case of a person who declares, by affidavit, that the person is indigent and who has filed a petition signed by currently registered voters who constitute at least one-half of one per cent of the total voters registered at the last preceding general election in the respective district or districts which correspond to the specific office for which the indigent person is a candidate.  This petition shall be submitted on the form prescribed and provided by the chief election officer together with the nomination paper required by this chapter.
