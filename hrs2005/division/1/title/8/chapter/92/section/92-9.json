Unless otherwise required by law, neither a full transcript nor a recording of the meeting is required, but the written minutes shall give a true reflection of the matters discussed at the meeting and the views of the participants.  The minutes shall include, but need not be limited to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe date, time and place of the meeting;\n\t(2)\tThe members of the board recorded as either present or absent;\n\t(3)\tThe substance of all matters proposed, discussed, or decided; and a record, by individual member, of any votes taken; and\n\t(4)\tAny other information that any member of the board requests be included or reflected in the minutes.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  The minutes shall be public records and shall be available within thirty days after the meeting except where such disclosure would be inconsistent with section 92-5; provided that minutes of executive meetings may be withheld so long as their publication would defeat the lawful purpose of the executive meeting, but no longer.\n\t(c)  All or any part of a meeting of a board may be recorded by any person in attendance by means of a tape recorder or any other means of sonic reproduction, except when a meeting is closed pursuant to section 92-4; provided the recording does not actively interfere with the conduct of the meeting. [L 1975, c 166, pt of \u00a71]\nAttorney General Opinions\n\n  This section and \u00a7\u00a792-1 and 92-7 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda; agency responsible to make its minutes available to public.  Att. Gen. Op. 85-2.\n  This section and \u00a792-5(a)(2) read together permit board and commission members to disclose some matters deliberated or decided in executive session, but they cannot disclose matters which would be inconsistent with \u00a792-5(a)(2), i.e., matters affecting privacy of individuals under consideration for hire and they must maintain this confidentiality for as long as disclosure would defeat purpose of convening the executive meeting.  Att. Gen. Op. 94-1."
