The commissioner shall disapprove the forms for such insurance if the commissioner finds:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThat they are unjust, inequitable, misleading, or deceptive; or\n\t(2)\tThat the rates are by reasonable assumptions excessive in relation to the benefits provided.\n\n\n\n\tIn determining whether the rates by reasonable assumptions are excessive in relation to the benefits provided, the commissioner shall give due consideration to past and prospective claim experience, within and outside this State, and to fluctuations in such claim experience, to a reasonable risk charge, to contribution to surplus and contingency funds, to past and prospective expenses, both within and outside this State, and to all other relevant factors within and outside this State, including any differing operating methods of the insurers joining in the issue of the policy.  In exercising the powers conferred by this part, the commissioner shall not be bound by any other requirement of this code with respect to standard provisions to be included in accident and health or sickness policies or forms.\n\t(c)  After hearing, upon written notice, the commissioner may withdraw an approval previously given if the commissioner is of the opinion that an original submission would have been disapproved.  Such withdrawal of approval shall be effective not less than ninety days after the giving of notice of withdrawal. [L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72; am L 2003, c 212, \u00a780]"
