    "text": "\u00a7490:2-720    Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of \"cancellation\" or \"rescission\" of the contract or the like shall not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent breach. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-720; HRS \u00a7490:2-720]\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:  None.\n Purposes:\n  This section is designed to safeguard a person holding a right of action from any unintentional loss of rights by the ill-advised use of such terms as \"cancellation\", \"rescission\", or the like.  Once a party's rights have accrued they are not to be lightly impaired by concessions made in business decency and without intention to forego them.  Therefore, unless the cancellation of a contract expressly declares that it is \"without reservation of rights\", or the like, it cannot be considered to be a renunciation under this section.\n Cross References:\n  Section 1-107.\n Definitional Cross References:\n  \"Cancellation\".  Section 2-106.\n  \"Contract\".  Section 1-201."
