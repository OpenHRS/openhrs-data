The prosecuting attorney, the defendant's probation officer, and the defendant may appear in the hearing to oppose or support the application, and may submit evidence for the court's consideration.  The defendant shall have the right to be represented by counsel.  For purposes of this section the court shall not be bound by the Hawaii rules of evidence, except for the rules pertaining to privileges.\n\t(3)  The court shall revoke probation if the defendant has inexcusably failed to comply with a substantial requirement imposed as a condition of the order or has been convicted of a felony.  The court may revoke the suspension of sentence or probation if the defendant has been convicted of another crime other than a felony.\n\t(4)  The court may modify the requirements imposed on the defendant or impose further requirements, if it finds that such action will assist the defendant in leading a law-abiding life.\n\t(5)  When the court revokes probation, it may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of which the defendant was convicted.\n\t(6)  As used in this section, \"conviction\" means that a judgment has been pronounced upon the verdict.\n\t(7)  Probation shall not be revoked for a first violation of the terms and conditions of probation involving possession or use, not including to distribute or manufacture as defined in section 712-1240, of any dangerous drug, detrimental drug, harmful drug, intoxicating compound, marijuana, or marijuana concentrate, as defined in section 712-1240, or involving possession or use of drug paraphernalia under section 329-43.5; provided that the person shall be required to undergo and complete a drug treatment program as a condition of continued probation.  If the person fails to complete the drug treatment program and if no other suitable treatment is amenable to the offender, the person shall be subject to revocation of probation and return to incarceration.  The court may require the person to contribute to the cost of the drug treatment program.\n\tAs used in this subsection, \"drug treatment program\" means drug or substance abuse services provided outside a correctional facility, but the services do not require the expenditure of state moneys beyond the limits of available appropriations.\n\tNothing in this subsection shall be construed to give rise to a cause of action against the State, state employee, or treatment provider.
