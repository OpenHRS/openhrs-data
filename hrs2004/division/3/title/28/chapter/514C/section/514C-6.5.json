The lessee shall further have the right to terminate such contract to purchase without penalty for a period of ninety days from the date the contract was first entered into;\n\t(2)\tAt the time any offer to sell the leased fee interest is communicated to the lessee by the lessor, the association of owners or cooperative housing corporation shall be provided with written notice delivered or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to any two of the president, vice-president, or managing agent (if any), of the lessor's intent to sell the interest, together with a complete and correct copy of the offer, which offer shall contain the full and complete terms thereof.  Except as provided in paragraph (3), where the board of directors of the association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation has written authorization to represent its members, then the association or corporation shall have a right of first refusal to purchase that leased fee interest for the same price as is contained in the written purchase offer; provided that the offer shall be deemed to be rejected if not accepted in writing by the board of directors of the condominium project or the cooperative housing corporation within one hundred twenty days of its receipt of written notice from the seller, as evidenced by the return receipts;\n\t(3)\tAny board of directors of the association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation may fully or partially waive its right of first refusal at any time with written notice to the lessor; provided that it shall waive its right of first refusal with respect to the leased fee interest appurtenant to a lessee's apartment at the written request of the lessee.  The legislature hereby gives the board of directors of the association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation the authority to exercise the foregoing waiver without having to amend any bylaws, charter, or other governing documents;\n\t(4)\tNotwithstanding any provision contained in any bylaws, or any amendment thereto or written authorization, authorizing the board of directors of the association of apartment owners or cooperative housing corporation to represent the individual lessees in the lease-to-fee conversion, each individual shall have the right to represent himself or herself in such lease-to-fee conversion by giving written notice of such desire to the lessor and the board of directors; and\n\t(5)\tAfter the lessor (or its agent or representative) has been able to hold one meeting with the lessees and has been able to provide a written summary of the meeting to the lessees, then for a period of ninety days thereafter, the lessor, its agents, employees, and representatives, shall not initiate communication with the lessees regarding the offer, although such parties may respond to inquiries made by lessees.
