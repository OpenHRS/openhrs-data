Rev. 213 (2016).\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 District court did not err by denying the motion to intervene by prospective intervenors who qualified as Native Hawaiians under a definition narrower than the definition in the 2011 legislation and who sought to challenge the more liberal definition, the creation of a Native Hawaiian government based on that definition, and the related expenditure of state trust funds intended to benefit Native Hawaiians. The prospective intervenors' interests would not be impaired or impeded as a result of the plaintiffs' litigation; their claims would raise entirely different issues from those raised by the plaintiffs and they could adequately protect their interests in separate litigation.\u00a0 835 F.3d 1003 (2016).\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' interlocutory appeal dismissed as moot, where plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction solely to prevent defendants from undertaking certain voter registration activities and from calling or holding racially-exclusive elections for Native Hawaiians.\u00a0 Given the changed circumstances, the court could not provide any effective relief sought in the preliminary injunction request; also, the appeal did not fall within an exception to the mootness doctrine.\u00a0 835 F.3d 1003 (2016)."
