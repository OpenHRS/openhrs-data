    "text": "No person shall act as a commission merchant, dealer, broker, agent, processor, or retail merchant without having obtained a license as prescribed by rules of the department.\n\tIn addition to the general requirements applicable to all classes of applications as prescribed by rule, the following requirements shall apply to each class of application noted:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tCommission merchants and brokers:  Each application shall include a schedule of commissions and charges for services, and the designated commissions and charges shall not be changed or varied for the license period except by written contract between the parties.  In addition, each application shall be accompanied by the surety bond required by section 145-4.\n\t(2)\tAgents:  Each application shall include the name and address of each commission merchant, dealer, or broker represented or sought to be represented by the agent, the written indorsement or nomination of the commission merchant, dealer, or broker, and such additional information as the department may consider proper or necessary.  The department shall thereupon issue to the applicant a license entitling the applicant to conduct the business described in the application at the place named in the application for a year from the date thereof, or until the same is revoked for cause; provided that the license of an agent shall expire upon the date of expiration of the license of the principal for whom the agent acts.  The department may also issue to each agent a card or cards which shall bear the signature of the agent, separate cards being required for each principal.  Any agent shall show the card or cards upon the request of any interested person.  Any agent who displays a void or expired license card shall be punished as provided in section 145-12.\n\n\n\n\tFraud or misrepresentation in making any application shall ipso facto work a revocation of any license granted thereunder.  All indicia of the possession of a license shall be at all times the property of the State and each licensee shall be entitled to the possession thereof only for the duration of the license.\n\tFor filing the application for license, each applicant shall pay a fee as prescribed by the department.\n\tShould any commission merchant, dealer, broker, agent, processor, or retail merchant refuse, fail, or neglect to apply for the renewal of a preexisting license within thirty days after the expiration thereof, a penalty of forty per cent shall apply to and be added to the original fee as prescribed by the department, and shall be paid by the applicant before the renewal license may be issued.\n\tAny person who has applied for and obtained a license within the classification of commission merchant, in the manner and upon payment of the fee set forth, may apply for and secure a license in the other classifications without payment of further fee, and upon further complying with those provisions of this part regulating the licensing of the other particular classification involved.  All licenses held by any licensee under this section shall automatically expire on the expiration date for the particular license for which the license fee was paid.
