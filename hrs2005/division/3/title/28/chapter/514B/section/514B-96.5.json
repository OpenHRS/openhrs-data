If two or more prospective owner-occupants intend to reside jointly in the same residential unit, only one of them shall be entitled to enter the public lottery; and\n\t(4)\tAfter the public lottery, each prospective owner-occupant purchaser, in the order in which they are selected in the lottery, shall be given the opportunity to select one of the residential units that have been designated pursuant to section 514B-96, execute a sales contract, and submit an earnest money deposit in a reasonable amount designated by the developer.
