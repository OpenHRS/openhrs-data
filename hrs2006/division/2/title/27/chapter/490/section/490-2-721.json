    "text": "Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this Article for nonfraudulent breach.\u00a0 Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-721; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\u00a0 To correct the situation by which remedies for fraud have been more circumscribed than the more modern and mercantile remedies for breach of warranty.\u00a0 Thus the remedies for fraud are extended by this section to coincide in scope with those for non-fraudulent breach.\u00a0 This section thus makes it clear that neither rescission of the contract for fraud nor rejection of the goods bars other remedies unless the circumstances of the case make the remedies incompatible.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Remedy\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
