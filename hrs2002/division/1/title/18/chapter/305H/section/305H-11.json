HAWAII STATE POSTSECONDARY REVIEW PROGRAM\n\n []    The legislature finds that the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-325, established the state postsecondary review program by adding a new Part H, Subpart 1, to Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965.  The state postsecondary review program ensures that institutions participating in Title IV student financial assistance programs meet appropriate standards of educational quality and integrity by increasing the accountability of those institutions through expanded state oversight of the institutions.  In order for the State to continue receiving all Title IV student financial assistance funds, the State's postsecondary review entity must conduct or coordinate the review of institutions of higher education in the State to determine their eligibility to receive Title IV student financial assistance funds and, further, to establish and administer procedures for receiving and responding to complaints from students, faculty, and others regarding institutions of higher education in the State.  The state postsecondary review program authorizes the United States Secretary of Education to enter into agreements with the states.  These agreements designate one state postsecondary review entity in each state to be responsible for the conduct or coordination of review of institutions and, also, provide federal funds to each state postsecondary review entity for performing the functions required by these agreements.  No state will be required to perform the review functions of the state postsecondary review program if the United States Congress does not appropriate funds for the program.\n\tAccordingly, the purpose of this part is to expressly authorize the commission to cooperate with the federal government in carrying out the purposes of the state postsecondary review program in the State.
