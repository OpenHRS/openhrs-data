The board of trustees or its designated agent shall monitor the market value of the loaned securities daily, and if, on any business day, the amount of the collateral deposited by the borrower is less than one hundred two per cent of the market value of the loaned securities on that day, the borrower shall immediately deposit with the board or its agent additional collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit, bonds, or other interest-bearing notes and obligations of the United States or federal instrumentalities which are eligible for investment by the board of trustees.  Such additional collateral, together with the collateral previously on deposit, shall be in an amount not less than one hundred two per cent of the market value of the loaned securities at the time of such deposit;\n\t(4)\tThe board of trustees, at its election, may use or invest any collateral delivered by a borrower to the board or its agent pursuant to the agreement, and any income and profits earned on the collateral shall be retained for the benefit of the system.  Any investment of the collateral shall be subject to section 88-119;\n\t(5)\tUntil the termination of the loan, the borrower may exercise all the incidents of ownership of loaned securities, including the right to transfer the loaned securities to others and vote or otherwise consent as a holder of such securities; provided that the borrower shall be obligated to the board of trustees for all dividends and distributions made with respect to the loaned securities during the period of the agreement, including, without limitation, cash, stock or property dividends or distributions, interest payments, and subscription rights;\n\t(6)\tIn the event that the borrower, at the termination of the loan period, fails to deliver to the board of trustees certificates for identical securities which are of the same class and issue as the loaned securities, the borrowers shall forfeit to the system the collateral deposited.
