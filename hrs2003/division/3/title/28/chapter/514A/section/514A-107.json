In the event that the presumed owner-occupant fails to submit verification of continuing owner-occupancy, as defined in this section, because of sale, lease, assignment, or transfer, the presumed owner-occupant may also be subject to a fine in the amount equal to the profit made from the sale, assignment or transfer.\n\t(e)  The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 91, to carry out the purposes of, and its responsibilities under, this part.
