The drawer or maker of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration.  If an instrument is issued for a promise of performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed.  If an instrument is issued for value as stated in subsection (a), the instrument is also issued for consideration. [L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a71]"
