The legislature sought to ensure compliance with and enforcement of the cigarette tax stamp laws.  House Standing Committee Report No. 502-02.\nCase Notes\n  Cash was not subject to forfeiture where, despite suspicious packaging and shipment of money and positive dog sniff test for drugs, State failed to present sufficient evidence to support finding that defendant had committed a covered offense.  73 H. 229, 832 P.2d 256.\n  The State must prove the existence of a substantial connection between the currency being forfeited and the illegal activity; where $1,300 of the subject currency was substantially connected to appellant's illegal gambling activity and \u00a7712A-11(4) provides that the State need not trace the proceeds exactly, $1,300 was properly ordered forfeited to the State.  104 H. 323, 89 P.3d 823.\n  Where State failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the subject currency of $1,900 seized from appellant's trousers was involved in appellant's gambling transactions, trial court erred in ordering currency forfeited to State; there was no evidence connecting currency to any illegal activity, and absent proof of a substantial connection between the illegal activity and the res, the currency was not subject to forfeiture.  104 H. 323, 89 P.3d 823."
