[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-607; HRS \u00a7490:2-607]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Subsection (1) - Section 41, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (2) and (3) - Sections 49 and 69, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To continue the prior basic policies with respect to acceptance of goods while making a number of minor though material changes in the interest of simplicity and commercial convenience so that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Under subsection (1), once the buyer accepts a tender the seller acquires a right to its price on the contract terms.\u00a0 In cases of partial acceptance, the price of any part accepted is, if possible, to be reasonably apportioned, using the type of apportionment familiar to the courts in quantum valebat cases, to be determined in terms of \"the contract rate,\" which is the rate determined from the bargain in fact (the agreement) after the rules and policies of this Article have been brought to bear.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Under subsection (2) acceptance of goods precludes their subsequent rejection.\u00a0 Any return of the goods thereafter must be by way of revocation of acceptance under the next section.\u00a0 Revocation is unavailable for a non-conformity known to the buyer at the time of acceptance, except where the buyer has accepted on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would be seasonably cured.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 All other remedies of the buyer remain unimpaired under subsection (2).\u00a0 This is intended to include the buyer's full rights with respect to future installments despite his acceptance of any earlier non-conforming installment.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The time of notification is to be determined by applying commercial standards to a merchant buyer.\u00a0 \"A reasonable time\" for notification from a retail consumer is to be judged by different standards so that in his case it will be extended, for the rule of requiring notification is designed to defeat commercial bad faith, not to deprive a good faith consumer of his remedy.\n\u00a0 The content of the notification need merely be sufficient to let the seller know that the transaction is still troublesome and must be watched.\u00a0 There is no reason to require that the notification which saves the buyer's rights under this section must include a clear statement of all the objections that will be relied on by the buyer, as under the section covering statements of defects upon rejection (Section 2-605).\u00a0 Nor is there reason for requiring the notification to be a claim for damages or of any threatened litigation or other resort to a remedy.\u00a0 The notification which saves the buyer's rights under this Article need only be such as informs the seller that the transaction is claimed to involve a breach, and thus opens the way for normal settlement through negotiation.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Under this Article various beneficiaries are given rights for injuries sustained by them because of the seller's breach of warranty.\u00a0 Such a beneficiary does not fall within the reason of the present section in regard to discovery of defects and the giving of notice within a reasonable time after acceptance, since he has nothing to do with acceptance.\u00a0 However, the reason of this section does extend to requiring the beneficiary to notify the seller that an injury has occurred.\u00a0 What is said above, with regard to the extended time for reasonable notification from the lay consumer after the injury is also applicable here; but even a beneficiary can be properly held to the use of good faith in notifying, once he has had time to become aware of the legal situation.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Subsection (4) unambiguously places the burden of proof to establish breach on the buyer after acceptance.\u00a0 However, this rule becomes one purely of procedure when the tender accepted was non-conforming and the buyer has given the seller notice of breach under subsection (3).\u00a0 For subsection (2) makes it clear that acceptance leaves unimpaired the buyer's right to be made whole, and that right can be exercised by the buyer not only by way of cross-claim for damages, but also by way of recoupment in diminution or extinction of the price.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Subsections (3)(b) and (5)(b) gives a warrantor against infringement an opportunity to defend or compromise third-party claims or be relieved of his liability.\u00a0 Subsection (5)(a) codifies for all warranties the practice of voucher to defend.\u00a0 Compare Section 3-803.\u00a0 Subsection (6) makes these provisions applicable to the buyer's liability for infringement under Section 2-312.\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 All of the provisions of the present section are subject to any explicit reservation of rights.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Section 2-608.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Sections 1-204 and 2-605.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Section 2-318.\n\u00a0 Point 6:\u00a0 Section 2-717.\n\u00a0 Point 7:\u00a0 Sections 2-312 and 3-803.\n\u00a0 Point 8:\u00a0 Section 1-207.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Burden of establishing\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Notifies\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Reasonable time\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0 \"Remedy\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seasonably\".\u00a0 Section 1-204.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\nDecisions under prior law.\n\u00a0 Buyer must give notice of non-compliance with contract, or silence will be deemed waiver.\u00a0 1 H. 268.\n\u00a0 Notice, reasonable time, year and one-half.\u00a0 198 F.
