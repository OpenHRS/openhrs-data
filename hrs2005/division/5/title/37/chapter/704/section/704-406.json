If the court is satisfied that the defendant may be released on condition without danger to the defendant or to the person or property of others, the court shall order the defendant's release, which shall continue at the discretion of the court, on conditions the court determines necessary.  A copy of the report filed pursuant to section 704-404 shall be attached to the order of commitment or order of conditional release.\n\t(2)  When the court, on its own motion or upon the application of the director of health, the prosecuting attorney, or the defendant, determines, after a hearing if a hearing is requested, that the defendant has regained fitness to proceed, the penal proceeding shall be resumed.  If, however, the court is of the view that so much time has elapsed since the commitment or conditional release of the defendant that it would be unjust to resume the proceeding, the court may dismiss the charge and may order the defendant to be discharged or, subject to the law governing the involuntary hospitalization or conditional release of persons suffering from physical or mental disease, disorder, or defect, order the defendant to be committed to the custody of the director of health to be placed in an appropriate institution for detention, care, and treatment or order the defendant to be released on conditions the court determines necessary.\n\t(3)  Within a reasonable time following any commitment under subsection (1), the director of health shall report to the court on whether the defendant presents a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.  The court, in addition, may appoint a panel of three qualified examiners in felony cases or one qualified examiner in nonfelony cases to make a report.  If, following a report, the court determines that the defendant probably will remain unfit to proceed, the court may dismiss the charge and release the defendant or subject the defendant to involuntary civil commitment procedures.\n\t(4)  Within a reasonable time following any conditional release under subsection (1), the court shall appoint a panel of three qualified examiners in felony cases or one qualified examiner in nonfelony cases to report to the court on whether the defendant presents a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.

Upon such a determination, the penal proceedings resume unless the court finds that such resumption would be unjust.  This section is designed to allow no hiatus in the procedure.\n  The Code, in its treatment of a defendant committed because of unfitness to proceed, conforms to the present Hawaii law which insures that a defendant so committed will remain in the custody of the director of health until the defendant has regained fitness.[1]  Previous Hawaii law had no provision for conditional release of unfit defendants.\n  The second sentence of subsection (2) follows the suggestion of the Model Penal Code[2] and permits \"the court to dismiss the prosecution if because of lapse of time it would be unjust to continue.\"[3]  Under the prior law the power to dismiss the prosecution was vested in the prosecutor's discretion to enter a nolle prosequi.  The Code accepts the position that\nthere is value... in vesting such a power in the Court, to be exercised either where because of the lapse of time a defendant is unable to produce certain witnesses or other evidence once available which is essential to his defense, or where because of the length of the intervening period which he has spent in a mental institution subsequent to the alleged wrongful conduct it seems unjust to subject him to trial and punishment.[4]\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n  Act 314, Session Laws 1986, added subsection (3), which implements the holding in State v. Raitz, 63 Haw. 64 (1980).  In Raitz, the court held that when a defendant is unlikely to become fit to proceed, due process requires that:  (1) following commitment, there should be a timely determination of the likelihood of the defendant regaining fitness; and (2) if the court determines that the defendant will probably remain unfit, the defendant should be released or civilly committed.  Conference Committee Report No. 51-86.\n  Act 87, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to require the court to appoint a panel of three qualified examiners to report on whether a defendant who has been conditionally released presents a substantial likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.  If the court determines that the defendant probably will remain unfit to proceed, it may dismiss the charge against the defendant or subject the defendant to involuntary civil commitment procedures.  In addition, this act allows the court, following the commitment of a defendant, to appoint a panel of three qualified examiners to report on the defendant's likelihood of becoming fit to proceed in the future.  House Standing Committee Report No. 185, Senate Standing Committee Report Nos. 1061 and 1263.\n  Act 306, Session Laws 1997, amended subsections (3) and (4) to allow mental health examinations to be conducted by one rather than three examiners in nonfelony cases, and to require three examiners in felony cases.  The amendment streamlines the process for committing and releasing mentally incompetent defendants.
