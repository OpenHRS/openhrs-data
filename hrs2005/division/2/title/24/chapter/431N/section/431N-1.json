    "text": "(a)  The legislature finds that despite the fact that Hawaii has the only statutorily mandated prepaid health care program in the country, as well as a broad-based medicaid program which provides an array of medical benefits to Hawaii's lowest income level residents, there remain in the State uninsured \"gap group individuals\".  Available statistics consistently reveal that an estimated five per cent of the civilian population of this State, or 50,000 individuals, lack any form of medical insurance whatsoever and are therefore limited in access to medical care.\n\t(b)  These \"gap group individuals\" are characterized by one or more of the following conditions or factors contributing to lack of insurance or \"medical indigency\":\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThey have too much income or too many assets to qualify for medicaid, but too little to afford private insurance;\n\t(2)\tThey do not qualify for prepaid health care insurance coverage through employment;\n\t(3)\tThey choose not to obtain health insurance; or\n\t(4)\tThey are dependents, primarily children of insureds who are not covered by their parent's, guardian's, or spouse's policies.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The legislature further finds that it is a matter of compelling public interest to provide for the health and well- being of all the people of this State.  This is also consistent with the health provisions of the Hawaii State Planning Act as set forth in section 226-20(a)(1), which establish as an objective the \"fulfillment of basic individual health needs of the general public.\"  This objective is construed to include access to basic health insurance coverage.  To responsibly carry out this objective, it is therefore appropriate that the legislature use innovative means to ensure that all residents, regardless of age, income, employment status, or any other factor, have access to health insurance coverage which will provide basic medical services necessary to sustain a healthy life.\n\t(d)  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a program within the department of health, funded through legislative appropriations, to ensure basic health insurance coverage is available for Hawaii residents who are medically uninsured and who are defined in section 431N-2 as \"gap group individuals\".
