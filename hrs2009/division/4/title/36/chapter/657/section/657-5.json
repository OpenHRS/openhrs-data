[CC 1859, \u00a71051; RL 1925, \u00a72643; am L 1927, c 16, \u00a71; RL 1935, \u00a73914; RL 1945, \u00a710425; RL 1955, \u00a7241-5; HRS ; am L 1972, c 105, \u00a71(d); am L 1992, c 74, \u00a71; am L 2001, c 145, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 District court erred in extending the judgment pursuant to a request that was not made within ten years after the original judgment was rendered.\u00a0 536 F.3d 980.\n\u00a0 Statute does not run during period decree not enforceable due to interest of a life tenant not subject to plaintiff's claim.\u00a0 20 H. 225.\n\u00a0 Applied to action seeking enforcement of promissory note where note was enforceable only as part of final divorce decree.\u00a0 73 H. 566, 836 P.2d 1081.\n\u00a0 Garnishment order conclusively presumed to be paid and discharged upon expiration of underlying judgment.\u00a0 82 H. 197, 921 P.2d 117.\n\u00a0 General scheme of \u00a7653-11 and this section is to terminate a judgment when judgment is actually paid or presumed to be paid as a matter of law.\u00a0 82 H. 197, 921 P.2d 117.\n\u00a0 Under this section, judgment, together with all rights and remedies appurtenant to it, are conclusively presumed paid and discharged after ten years unless timely renewed.\u00a0 82 H. 197, 921 P.2d 117.\n\u00a0 This section controls over HRCP rule 5(a); thus, notice of a proposed extension of a judgment pursuant to this section must be provided to the judgment debtor prior to the granting of the extension, even if the debtor is in default and is not required under rule 5(a) to be served with pleadings; although failure to provide notice under \u00a7657-7 was error, error was harmless where debtor never appeared to defend debtor's self, had an opportunity to be heard at a HRCP rule 60(b) hearing, and offered no defense on the merits to the original judgment or extension, and thus failed to demonstrate any prejudice.\u00a0 120 H. 1, 200 P.3d 370.\n\u00a0 Limitations period begins to run on each child support payment as it becomes due; decree creditor may avoid effect of statute of limitations on part of decree debt for which statute has not run by obtaining new decree on unbarred debt.\u00a0 6 H. App. 201, 716 P.2d 496.\n\u00a0 License revocation order is more like administrative order than judgment subject to ten-year limitations period.\u00a0 9 H. App. 169, 828 P.2d 1287.\n\u00a0 The notice requirement contained in this section does not apply to defaulted parties who have not appeared; thus, defendant, as a judgment debtor in default, was not entitled to notice of extension proceedings instituted pursuant to this section.\u00a0 118 H. 132 (App.), 185 P.3d 880.\n\u00a0 Where the August 28, 1996 judgment was the \"original judgment\" for purposes of the case and the limitation period for a ten-year extension commenced on the August 28, 1996 judgment entry date, trial court erred in concluding that a October 21, 1996 amended judgment was \"extinguished\" when it was subsequently reversed, vacated and remanded in part by the Hawaii supreme court and that the limitation period commenced on the October 18, 1999 and September 6, 2001 entry dates of the second and fourth amended judgments; thus, motions to extend filed on May 8, 2007 were untimely.\u00a0 120 H. 123 (App.), 202 P.3d 584.\n\u00a0 Cited:\u00a0 9 H. 514, 517."
