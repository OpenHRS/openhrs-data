Likewise, organizations one of whose principal functions is to provide services to persons who are eligible for membership in the credit union may be admitted to membership.  Other organizations having a commonality of interest with the credit union may be admitted to membership with the approval of the commissioner.\n\t(c)  Any credit union organized under this article may accept as a member any other credit union organized under this chapter or federal law.\n\t(d)  The board of directors shall act on all membership applications, unless the board has appointed one or more membership officers, who shall be empowered to approve or disapprove membership applications according to criteria established in the bylaws and under the direction of the board.  A record of the actions taken by a membership officer shall be made available in writing to the board of directors for inspection.  Any person whose application has been disapproved may appeal such decision to the board in writing.\n\t(e)  Members who cease to be eligible for membership may be permitted to retain their membership in the credit union, under reasonable standards established by the board of directors.\n\t(f)  The members of a credit union shall not be personally or individually liable for the payment of the credit union's debts solely by virtue of holding membership.\n\t(g)  The board of directors may expel a member from membership in the credit union, if such member fails to comply with the articles, bylaws, rules, or regulations of the credit union, any law applicable to the credit union, or for any other just cause; provided that no member may be expelled unless:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe member has been informed in writing of the reasons for the expulsion;\n\t(2)\tThe member has, upon request, a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and argue against the expulsion, before a hearing panel consisting of the board of directors and the supervisory committee; and\n\t(3)\tIf the hearing is requested, a majority of the hearing panel votes to expel the member.\n\n\n\nThe amounts paid by an expelled member for shares of the credit union shall be paid to such member after deducting any amounts due by such member to the credit union; provided that such expulsion shall not relieve the expelled member from any remaining liability to the credit union.\n\t(h)  Any proposed change to a credit union's field of membership, whether it is an addition, deletion, or simple update, shall require the prior written approval of the commissioner.  Upon receipt of the commissioner's approval, the change shall be reflected formally in the credit union's articles of association. [L 1993, c 350, pt of \u00a71; am L 1995, c 57, \u00a71]"
