The statement shall list the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all officers, agents, servants, employees, directors, and independent contractors of a professional fund- raising counsel, and the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all officers, agents, servants, employees, directors, and independent contractors of a professional solicitor.  Renewal statements shall be filed with the department on or before July 1 of each calendar year in which the professional fund-raising counsel or professional solicitor does business in or from the State and shall be effective until June 30 of the next calendar year.  The renewal statement shall be in a form prescribed by the director.  A renewal fee of $50, or in any amount and with any additional sums as may be prescribed by the director, shall accompany the renewal statement.\n\t(b)  The professional fund-raising counsel or professional solicitor, at the time of each filing, shall file with and have approved by the director a bond in which the applicant is the principal obligor in the penal sum of $5,000 issued with good and sufficient surety or sureties approved by the director and which shall remain in effect for one year.

The charitable organization shall make best efforts to notify donors of their option of receiving a refund.  All moneys not claimed by the donors shall be the sole property of the charitable organization. [L 1969, c 167, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1985; am L 1993, c 206, \u00a713]"
