[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-314; HRS \u00a7490:2-314]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 15(2), Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Completely rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 This section, drawn in view of the steadily developing case law on the subject, is intended to make it clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The seller's obligation applies to present sales as well as to contracts to sell subject to the effects of any examination of specific goods.\u00a0 (Subsection (2) of Section 2-316).\u00a0 Also, the warranty of merchantability applies to sales for use as well as to sales for resale.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The question when the warranty is imposed turns basically on the meaning of the terms of the agreement as recognized in the trade.\u00a0 Goods delivered under an agreement made by a merchant in a given line of trade must be of a quality comparable to that generally acceptable in that line of trade under the description or other designation of the goods used in the agreement.\u00a0 The responsibility imposed rests on any merchant-seller, and the absence of the words \"grower or manufacturer or not\" which appeared in Section 15(2) of the Uniform Sales Act does not restrict the applicability of this section.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 A specific designation of goods by the buyer does not exclude the seller's obligation that they be fit for the general purposes appropriate to such goods.\u00a0 A contract for the sale of second-hand goods, however, involves only such obligation as is appropriate to such goods for that is their contract description.\u00a0 A person making an isolated sale of goods is not a \"merchant\" within the meaning of the full scope of this section and, thus, no warranty of merchantability would apply.\u00a0 His knowledge of any defects not apparent on inspection would, however, without need for express agreement and in keeping with the underlying reason of the present section and the provisions on good faith, impose an obligation that known material but hidden defects be fully disclosed.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Although a seller may not be a \"merchant\" as to the goods in question, if he states generally that they are \"guaranteed\" the provisions of this section may furnish a guide to the content of the resulting express warranty.\u00a0 This has particular significance in the case of second-hand sales, and has further significance in limiting the effect of fine-print disclaimer clauses where their effect would be inconsistent with large- print assertions of \"guarantee\".\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The second sentence of subsection (1) covers the warranty with respect to food and drink.\u00a0 Serving food or drink for value is a sale, whether to be consumed on the premises or elsewhere.\u00a0 Cases to the contrary are rejected.\u00a0 The principal warranty is that stated in subsections (1) and (2)(c) of this section.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Subsection (2) does not purport to exhaust the meaning of \"merchantable\" nor to negate any of its attributes not specifically mentioned in the text of the statute, but arising by usage of trade or through case law.\u00a0 The language used is \"must be at least such as...,\" and the intention is to leave open other possible attributes of merchantability.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) are to be read together.\u00a0 Both refer, as indicated above, to the standards of that line of the trade which fits the transaction and the seller's business.\u00a0 \"Fair average\" is a term directly appropriate to agricultural bulk products and means goods centering around the middle belt of quality, not the least or the worst that can be understood in the particular trade by the designation, but such as can pass \"without objection.\" Of course a fair percentage of the least is permissible but the goods are not \"fair average\" if they are all of the least or worst quality possible under the description.\u00a0 In cases of doubt as to what quality is intended, the price at which a merchant closes a contract is an excellent index of the nature and scope of his obligation under the present section.\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 Fitness for the ordinary purposes for which goods of the type are used is a fundamental concept of the present section and is covered in paragraph (c).\u00a0 As stated above, merchantability is also a part of the obligation owing to the purchaser for use.\u00a0 Correspondingly, protection, under this aspect of the warranty, of the person buying for resale to the ultimate consumer is equally necessary, and merchantable goods must therefore be \"honestly\" resalable in the normal course of business because they are what they purport to be.\n\u00a0 9.\u00a0 Paragraph (d) on evenness of kind, quality and quantity follows case law.\u00a0 But precautionary language has been added as a reminder of the frequent usages of trade which permit substantial variations both with and without an allowance or an obligation to replace the varying units.\n\u00a0 10.\u00a0 Paragraph (e) applies only where the nature of the goods and of the transaction require a certain type of container, package or label.\u00a0 Paragraph (f) applies, on the other hand, wherever there is a label or container on which representations are made, even though the original contract, either by express terms or usage of trade, may not have required either the labelling or the representation.\u00a0 This follows from the general obligation of good faith which requires that a buyer should not be placed in the position of reselling or using goods delivered under false representations appearing on the package or container.\u00a0 No problem of extra consideration arises in this connection since, under this Article, an obligation is imposed by the original contract not to deliver mislabeled articles, and the obligation is imposed where mercantile good faith so requires and without reference to the doctrine of consideration.\n\u00a0 11.\u00a0 Exclusion or modification of the warranty of merchantability, or of any part of it, is dealt with in the section to which the text of the present section makes explicit precautionary references.\u00a0 That section must be read with particular reference to its subsection (4) on limitation of remedies.\u00a0 The warranty of merchantability, wherever it is normal, is so commonly taken for granted that its exclusion from the contract is a matter threatening surprise and therefore requiring special precaution.\n\u00a0 12.\u00a0 Subsection (3) is to make explicit that usage of trade and course of dealing can create warranties and that they are implied rather than express warranties and thus subject to exclusion or modification under Section 2-316.\u00a0 A typical instance would be the obligation to provide pedigree papers to evidence conformity of the animal to the contract in the case of a pedigreed dog or blooded bull.\n\u00a0 13.\u00a0 In an action based on breach of warranty, it is of course necessary to show not only the existence of the warranty but the fact that the warranty was broken and that the breach of the warranty was the proximate cause of the loss sustained.\u00a0 In such an action an affirmative showing by the seller that the loss resulted from some action or event following his own delivery of the goods can operate as a defense.\u00a0 Equally, evidence indicating that the seller exercised care in the manufacture, processing or selection of the goods is relevant to the issue of whether the warranty was in fact broken.\u00a0 Action by the buyer following an examination of the goods which ought to have indicated the defect complained of can be shown as matter bearing on whether the breach itself was the cause of the injury.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 2-316.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 1-203 and
