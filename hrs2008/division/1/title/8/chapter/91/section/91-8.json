    "text": "Any interested person may petition an agency for a declaratory order as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the agency.\u00a0 Each agency shall adopt rules prescribing the form of the petitions and the procedure for their submission, consideration, and prompt disposition.\u00a0 Orders disposing of petitions in such cases shall have the same status as other agency orders. [L 1961, c 103, \u00a78; Supp, \u00a76C-8; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Hawaii public employment relations board was empowered to make declaratory ruling regarding whether violation of collective bargaining agreement is a prohibited practice.\u00a0 60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.\n\u00a0 Where an agency employee's only interest in obtaining a declaratory ruling from that agency stems from his or her work as an agency employee, that interest is insufficient to satisfy this section's standing requirements; where executive director's interest in filing the petition stemmed from the director's work as executive director, the Hawaii civil rights commission did not have jurisdiction to issue a declaratory order on the petition.\u00a0 104 H. 158, 86 P.3d 449.\n\u00a0 As both the title and the pertinent text make clear, the declaratory ruling procedure of this section is meant to provide a means of seeking a determination of whether and in what way some statute, agency rule, or order, applies to the factual situation raised by an interested person; it was not intended to allow review of concrete agency decisions for which other means of review are available.\u00a0 114 H. 184, 159 P.3d 143.\n\u00a0 Orders disposing of petitions for declaratory rulings under this section are appealable to the circuit court pursuant to \u00a791-14; thus, circuit court had proper jurisdiction to review Hawaii labor relations board order.\u00a0 107 H. 178, 111 P.3d 587."
