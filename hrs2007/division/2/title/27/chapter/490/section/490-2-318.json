[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-318; HRS ; am L 1969, c 101, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The last sentence of this section does not mean that a seller is precluded from excluding or disclaiming a warranty which might otherwise arise in connection with the sale provided such exclusion or modification is permitted by Section 2-316.\u00a0 Nor does that sentence preclude the seller from limiting the remedies of his own buyer and of any beneficiaries, in any manner provided in Sections 2-718 or 2-719.\u00a0 To the extent that the contract of sale contains provisions under which warranties are excluded or modified, or remedies for breach are limited, such provisions are equally operative against beneficiaries of warranties under this section.\u00a0 What this last sentence forbids is exclusion of liability by the seller to the persons to whom the warranties which he has made to his buyer would extend under this section.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The purpose of this section is to give the buyer's family, household and guests the benefit of the same warranty which the buyer received in the contract of sale, thereby freeing any such beneficiaries from any technical rules as to \"privity.\" It seeks to accomplish this purpose without any derogation of any right or remedy resting on negligence.\u00a0 It rests primarily upon the merchant-seller's warranty under this Article that the goods sold are merchantable and fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used rather than the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.\u00a0 Implicit in the section is that any beneficiary of a warranty may bring a direct action for breach of warranty against the seller whose warranty extends to him.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 This section expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser.\u00a0 Beyond this, the section is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing case law on whether the seller's warranties, given to his buyer who resells, extend to other persons in the distributive chain.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Sections 2-316, 2-718 and 2-719.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Section 2-314.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Although plaintiff's pacemaker did not malfunction, it was in a defective and therefore unmerchantable condition sufficient to support action for breach of implied warranty of merchantability.\u00a0 74 H. 1, 837 P.2d 1273.\n\u00a0\nDecisions under prior law.\n\u00a0 Warranty to other than buyer, privity.\u00a0 198 F. Supp. 78, aff'd 304 F.2d 149."
