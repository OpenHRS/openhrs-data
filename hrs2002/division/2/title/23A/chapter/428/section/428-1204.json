    "text": "(a)  The director may direct to any limited liability company or foreign limited liability company subject to this chapter, and to any member or manager of any limited liability company or foreign limited liability company subject to this chapter, any interrogatories reasonably necessary and proper to enable the director to ascertain whether the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company has complied with all of the provisions of this chapter applicable to the limited liability company or foreign limited liability company. \tThe interrogatories shall be answered within thirty days after the date of mailing, or within such additional time as shall be fixed by the director.  The answers to the interrogatories shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing and under oath.  If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they shall be answered by the individual, and if directed to a limited liability company or foreign limited liability company, they shall be answered by a manager of a manager-managed company, a member of a member-managed company, or fiduciary if the company is in the hands of a receiver, trustee, or other court appointed fiduciary.\n\tThe director need not file any record in a court of competent jurisdiction to which the interrogatories relate until the interrogatories are answered as provided in this section, and not then if the answers thereto disclose that the record is not in conformity with the requirements of this chapter.  The director shall certify to the attorney general, for such action as the attorney general may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers which disclose a violation of this chapter.\n\t(b)  Interrogatories initiated by the director and the answers shall not be open to public inspection, nor shall the director disclose any facts or information obtained through interrogatories, except insofar as the director's official duty may require the disclosure to be made public, or in the event the interrogatories or the answers are required for evidence in any criminal proceedings, or in any other action by this State.
