The director, on application, shall renew a permit from time to time for a term not exceeding five years if the director determines that it is in the public interest.  The director shall not deny an application for the issuance or renewal of a permit without affording the applicant an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 91.\n\tThe director may require a public notice or hearing, or both, for permit issuances, reissuances, denial, revocation, suspension, or substantial modifications to a permit requested by a permittee, or modifications to a permit initiated by the director if the director determines that notice or hearing, or both, are in the public interest.\n\tThe director, on the director\u0092s own motion or the application of any person, may modify, suspend, or revoke any permit if, after affording the permittee an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with chapter 91, the director determines that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThere is a violation of any condition of the permit;\n\t(2)\tThe permit was obtained by misrepresentation, or failure to disclose fully all relevant facts;\n\t(3)\tThere is a change in any condition that requires either a temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the permitted emission; or\n\t(4)\tThe modification, suspension, or revocation is in the public interest.\n\n\n\n\tIn determining the public interest, the director shall consider the environmental impact of the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects of the proposed action, any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided if the action is implemented, the alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between local short-term uses of the environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented, and any other factors which the director may by rule prescribe; provided that any determination of public interest shall promote the optimum balance between economic development and environmental quality.\n\t(d)  The failure of the director to act on an application for the issuance of a permit or an application by a permit holder for the modification or renewal thereof within one hundred eighty days of the receipt of the application, shall be deemed a grant of the application; provided that the applicant acts consistently with the application and all plans, specifications, and other information submitted as a part thereof.\n\t(e)  No applicant for a modification or renewal of a permit shall be held in violation of this part during the pendency of the applicant\u0092s application; provided that the applicant acts consistently with the permit previously granted, the application and all plans, specifications, and other information submitted as a part thereof.
