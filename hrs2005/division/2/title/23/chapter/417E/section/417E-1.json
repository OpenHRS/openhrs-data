A person shall be deemed the beneficial owner of securities beneficially owned by any relative or spouse or relative of the spouse residing in the home of this person, any trust or estate in which this person owns ten per cent or more of the total beneficial interest or serves as trustee or executor, any corporation or entity in which this person owns ten per cent or more of the equity, and any affiliate or associate of this person.\n\t\"Broker-dealer\" means a \"dealer\" as defined in section 485-1.\n\t\"Commissioner\" means the commissioner of securities as provided for in chapter 485.\n\t\"Equity security\" means any stock or similar security; or any security convertible, with or without consideration, into such a security; or carrying any warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase such a security; or any such warrant or right; or any other security which the commissioner deems to be of similar nature and considers necessary or appropriate, by such rules as the commissioner may prescribe in the public interest and for the protection of investors, to treat as an equity security.\n\t\"Offeree\" means the beneficial owner, residing in Hawaii, of equity securities which an offeror offers to acquire in connection with a take-over offer.\n\t\"Offeror\" means a person who makes or in any way participates in making a take-over offer.
