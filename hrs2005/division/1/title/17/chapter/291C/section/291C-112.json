[L 1972, c 48, pt of \u00a72]\nCase Notes\n  Because defendant was a person to whom this section directly applied, and defendant's expressive conduct was not at issue, defendant did not have standing to assert overbreadth challenge based on a hypothetical application of this section.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.\n  No equal protection violation as section rationally furthers legitimate state interest in protecting health and welfare of public at large.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170.\n  This section, which prohibits the use of a vehicle \"for purposes of human habitation\", not unconstitutionally vague.  82 H. 269 (App.), 921 P.2d 1170."
