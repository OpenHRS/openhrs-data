    "text": "The department of taxation shall prepare and maintain, open to public inspection, a complete record of the amounts of taxes assessed in each district that have become delinquent with the name of the delinquent taxpayer in each case, but it shall not be necessary to periodically compute on the records the amount of penalties and interest upon delinquent taxes.  \tThe department may from time to time prepare lists of all taxes delinquent which in its judgment are uncollectible.  Such taxes as the department finds to be uncollectible shall be entered in a special record and be deleted from the other books kept by the department, and the department shall thereupon be released from any further accountability for their collection; provided that no account shall be so deleted until it shall have been delinquent for at least two years.  Any items so written off may be transferred back to the delinquent tax roll if the department finds that the alleged facts as previously presented to it were not true, or that such items are in fact collectible.
