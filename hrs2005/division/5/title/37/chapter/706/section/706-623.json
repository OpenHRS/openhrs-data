Prior to granting early discharge, the court shall afford the prosecuting attorney an opportunity to be heard.  The terms of probation provided in this part, other than in this section, shall not apply to sentences of probation imposed under section 706-606.3.\n\t(2)  When a defendant who is sentenced to probation has previously been detained in any state or county correctional or other institution following arrest for the crime for which sentence is imposed, the period of detention following arrest shall be deducted from the term of imprisonment if the term is given as a condition of probation.  The pre-sentence report shall contain a certificate showing the length of such detention of the defendant prior to sentence in any state or county correctional or other institution, and the certificate shall be annexed to the official records of the defendant's sentence.

Whether the defendant should be sentenced to probation because the defendant needs supervision, guidance, assistance, or direction is an independent question; there is no rational basis for providing a longer period for suspension than for probation.\n  Because of the structure of courts in Hawaii, some anomalous results obtained under prior law.  Upon the appeal of a misdemeanor case from the district court to the circuit court, the defendant, if conviction was upheld, could have had the defendant's sentence suspended or be sentenced to probation in the same manner and for the same period as a convicted felon.[3]  Had the misdemeanant not appealed the misdemeanant would have been subject solely to the district court, the powers of which were more limited in this area.  Prior to this Code, the district court did not have a probation service; however, the district magistrate could suspend the imposition or execution of sentence on the terms or conditions the district magistrate deemed best.  The period of suspension could not, however, exceed thirteen months.[4]\n  The changes which this section makes in the law are obvious.  It provides a maximum period of suspension of sentence or probation for misdemeanants, petty misdemeanants, and felons regardless of the court handling the case.  Secondly, it would allow probation to be utilized by district court magistrates if a probation service is established in that court.\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n  Section 623 of the Proposed Code provided that the period of suspension or probation shall be two years in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor or petty misdemeanor.  However, the Legislature reduced the period to one year in the case of a conviction for a misdemeanor and six months in the case of a conviction for a petty misdemeanor, finding the proposed two-year period too severe and inconsistent with the actual length of imprisonment allowed upon conviction for these offenses.  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n  Act 124, Session Laws 1989, required courts to grant pre-sentence imprisonment credit to defendants who had been sentenced to imprisonment as a condition of probation and who were detained prior to sentencing.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1342.\n  Act 316, Session Laws 1993, amended this section to provide that the terms of probation in chapter 706, part II, other than in this section, shall not apply to sentences of probation imposed under \u00a7706-606.3, which creates an option for the expedited sentencing of persons who have committed intra-family sexual assault.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1174, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 849.\n  Act 229, Session Laws 1994, amended this section to provide, inter alia, that when a defendant is sentenced to be placed on probation, the period of probation shall be ten years upon conviction of a class A felony unless the court enters the reason therefor on the record and sentences the defendant to a shorter period of probation.  The legislature found that a longer probationary period for class A felony drug offenders would protect the public's interests and safety in the unusual cases where probation may be granted.  Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n  Act 157, Session Laws 1995, extended the sunset date of the amendment to this section made by Act 316, Session Laws 1993, from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 2001.  The legislature found that the expedited sentencing program served as \"a viable alternative in a small number of select cases\" and that the program should continue to be available within the criminal justice system.  However, the legislature believed that there was insufficient basis to determine whether the program should be made permanent.  Conference Committee Report No. 62.\n  Act 172, Session Laws 1998, amended this section to allow for a two-year sentence of probation for domestic violence convictions.  Conference Committee Report No. 80.\n  Act 127, Session Laws 2001, repealed the sunset date for the expedited sentencing program of the family court, and in doing so, also prevented the possibility of the inadvertent repeal of important probation laws established in connection with the program.  The purpose of the program was to allow for the expeditious removal of the offender from the family home, in cases of intra-family felony sexual assault or incest, thus allowing the child to remain in the home.  The legislature found that the program applied only to those offenders found to be \"safe to probate\" and minimized the possibility of revictimizing the child by eliminating the need to testify and requiring treatment and supervision of all members of the child's family.  The legislature further found that the program had been effective and beneficial to the families concerned.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1453, Conference Committee Report No. 114.\nCase Notes\n  Subsection (2) pertains to periods of detention served following arrest and prior to the sentence imposed by the court in the first instance; circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to credit defendant for time served in conjunction with previous periods of probation.  79 H. 194, 900 P.2d 770.\n  Section does not authorize trial court to compel a criminal defendant to execute a promissory note in the amount of any restitution order, or any balance thereof, as a condition of probation.  83 H. 105, 924 P.2d 1211.\n  Defendant was not statutorily entitled to credit for time served under presentence house arrest where conditions and restrictions of house arrest did not amount to detention in a \"state or county institution\"; as defendant enjoyed no visitation, living environment, or telephone or other communicative restrictions, and was under the direct supervision of private citizens, including parents, relatives and friends, defendant was not confined in an \"other institution\" within the meaning of subsection (2).  94 H. 315, 13 P.3d 324.\n  To fall within the ambit of subsection (2), a defendant detained in an \"other institution\" must be confined in such a manner as to be tantamount to imprisonment in a state or county correctional institution; defendant must be under the direct supervision and control of state or county actors, or actors under state or county control, such as subcontracted halfway houses or drug treatment centers.  94 H. 315, 13 P.3d 324.\nCited:  146 F.3d 661.\n__________\n Commentary:\n1.
