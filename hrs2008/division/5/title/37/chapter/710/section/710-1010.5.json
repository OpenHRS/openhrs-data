    "text": "(1)\u00a0 A person commits the offense of interference with reporting an emergency or crime if the person intentionally or knowingly prevents a victim or witness to a criminal act from calling a 911-emergency telephone system, obtaining medical assistance, or making a report to a law enforcement officer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Interference with the reporting of an emergency or crime is a petty misdemeanor. [L 2001, c 294, \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7710-1010.5\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 294, Session Laws 2001, established interference with the reporting of an emergency or crime as a petty misdemeanor.\u00a0 The legislature found that perpetrators of domestic violence should not prevent victims and witnesses from contacting authorities for assistance in preventing domestic violence.\u00a0 House Standing Committee Report No. 1222.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Although the family court erroneously combined the attendant-circumstances (that complainant was a victim of a crime) and results-of-conduct (that defendant prevented complainant from calling 911) elements into one instruction, it did not adversely affect defendant\u0092s substantial rights where it was reasonably clear from the instruction that the jury was required to find that the defendant (1) intentionally or knowingly engaged in conduct, and (2) intended or knew that such conduct prevented a victim or witness to a criminal act from calling the 911 emergency system.\u00a0 117 H. 336 (App.), 181 P.3d 415."
