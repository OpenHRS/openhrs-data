[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  The draft follows the Model Penal Code in defining a standard of proof of facts called for in application of the Code.  It would cover, for example, a finding that the defendant lacks mental capacity to proceed.[1]  It logically places the burden of proof on the side whose interest or contention would be furthered if the finding is made.  Proof must be by a preponderance of the evidence.  Thus when facts making the defendant subject to increased penalties must be proved,[2] the prosecution need not prove them beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by preponderant evidence.  The Model Penal Code draftsmen explain:\n\n\t... proof that satisfies the court is not likely to leave room for a substantial doubt; and this, in our view, affords an adequate protection in an area where we deliberately have sought to broaden the discretion of the court.[3]\n\n\n__________\n Commentary:\n1.
