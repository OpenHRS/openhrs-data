The employer shall make every reasonable effort to consult with exclusive representatives and consider their input, along with the input of other affected parties, prior to effecting changes in any major policy affecting employee relations.\n\t(d)  [Repeal and reenactment on July 1, 2008.  L 2005, c 245, \u00a78.]  Excluded from the subjects of negotiations are matters of classification, reclassification, benefits of but not contributions to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund or a voluntary employees' beneficiary association trust; recruitment; examination; initial pricing; and retirement benefits except as provided in section 88-8(h).  The employer and the exclusive representative shall not agree to any proposal that would be inconsistent with the merit principle or the principle of equal pay for equal work pursuant to section 76-1 or that would interfere with the rights and obligations of a public employer to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tDirect employees;\n\t(2)\tDetermine qualifications, standards for work, and the nature and contents of examinations;\n\t(3)\tHire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees in positions;\n\t(4)\tSuspend, demote, discharge, or take other disciplinary action against employees for proper cause;\n\t(5)\tRelieve an employee from duties because of lack of work or other legitimate reason;\n\t(6)\tMaintain efficiency and productivity, including maximizing the use of advanced technology, in government operations;\n\t(7)\tDetermine methods, means, and personnel by which the employer's operations are to be conducted; and\n\t(8)\tTake such actions as may be necessary to carry out the missions of the employer in cases of emergencies.\n\n\n\n\tThe employer and the exclusive representative may negotiate procedures governing the promotion and transfer of employees to positions within a bargaining unit; the suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary actions taken against employees within the bargaining unit; and the layoff of employees within the bargaining unit.  Violations of the procedures so negotiated may be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement.\n\t(e)  [Repeal and reenactment on July 1, 2008.  L 2005, c 245, \u00a78.]  Negotiations relating to contributions to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund or a voluntary employees' beneficiary association trust shall be for the purpose of agreeing upon the amounts that the State and counties shall contribute under sections 87A-32 through 87A-37, toward the payment of the costs for a health benefits plan, as defined in section 87A-1 and group life insurance benefits, and the parties shall not be bound by the amounts contributed under prior agreements; provided that section 89-11 for the resolution of disputes by way of arbitration shall not be available to resolve impasses or disputes relating to the amounts the State and counties shall contribute to the Hawaii employer-union health benefits trust fund or a voluntary employees' beneficiary association trust established under chapter 87D.\n\t(f)  The repricing of classes within an appropriate bargaining unit may be negotiated as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAt the request of the exclusive representative and at times allowed under the collective bargaining agreement, the employer shall negotiate the repricing of classes within the bargaining unit.  The negotiated repricing actions that constitute cost items shall be subject to the requirements in section 89-10.\n\t(2)\tIf repricing has not been negotiated under paragraph (1), the employer of each jurisdiction shall ensure establishment of procedures to periodically review, at least once in five years, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the repricing of classes within the bargaining unit.  The repricing of classes based on the results of the periodic review shall be at the discretion of the employer.  Any appropriations required to implement the repricing actions that are made at the employer's discretion shall not be construed as cost items.

Att. Gen. Op. 74-12.\nCase Notes\n\n  Where dates upon which plaintiffs were paid were not a \"cost item\" as that term is defined in \u00a789-2, plaintiffs' contention that timing of their paychecks as it stood on June 30, 1999 was continued another two years until July 1, 2001 by Act 100, L 1999 (which, inter alia, amended this section), lacked merit.  Even if payroll lag was a cost item, the collective bargaining agreement expired on June 30, 1999; plaintiffs' rights under the collective bargaining agreement expired on that day.  125 F. Supp. 2d 1237.\n  Board was empowered to make declaratory judgment regarding validity of collective bargaining agreement.  60 H. 436, 591 P.2d 113.\n  Section does not bar arbitration of grievances over tenure and promotion.  66 H. 207, 659 P.2d 717.\n  Does not limit board's power to order union to implement staffing of essential positions.  66 H. 461, 667 P.2d 783.\n  Policy statement was not bargainable to the extent that it constituted compliance with the Drug-Free Workplace Act.  Because the Act inherently mandated implementation, appellant need not wait until appellee attempted an implementation of an apparatus to effectuate the policy; because implementation would affect bargainable topics, appellant may initiate bargaining at any time upon such topics.  79 H. 154, 900 P.2d 161.\n  County did not violate collective bargaining statutes by refusing to bargain over effects of privatization where because privatization effort was contrary to law, it was outside scope of negotiable topics.  85 H. 61, 937 P.2d 397.\n  Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 violated the rights of public employees under article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution by amending this section to prohibit public employers and public employees' unions from collectively bargaining over cost items for the biennium 1999 to 2001.  100 H. 138, 58 P.3d 649.\n  Section 2 of Act 100, L 1999 (which amended subsection (a)) violated article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution because it withdrew from the collective bargaining process core subjects such as wages, hours, and other conditions of employment that the voters contemplated would be part of the bargaining process when they ratified article XIII, \u00a72.  101 H. 46, 62 P.3d 189.\n  The general prohibition in subsection (d) against a public employer and the exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit agreeing to a \"proposal inconsistent with merit principles\" is subject to this subsection's provisions allowing for, inter alia, negotiation of promotion and demotion procedures in a collective bargaining agreement and a grievance process for violation thereof; \u00a776-1, Revised Charter of Honolulu \u00a7\u00a76-302, 6-306, 6-308, and rules of the civil service commission \u00a7\u00a713-2 and 13-3 do not conflict with subsection (d).  106 H. 205, 103 P.3d 365.\n  In light of the plain language of subsection (d), labor relations board erred in concluding that the city's proposed transfer of refuse workers from one location to another was subject to collective bargaining under subsection (a).  106 H. 359, 105 P.3d 236.\n  As subsection (d) precludes collective bargaining over classification issues and thus places them out of the reach of an arbitrator, who derived jurisdiction and authority from the collective bargaining agreement, arbitrator lacked arbitral jurisdiction.  101 H. 11 (App.), 61 P.3d 522.\nHawaii Legal Reporter Citations\n\n  Mandatory subjects of negotiation--classification plans.  78-2 HLR 78-939."
