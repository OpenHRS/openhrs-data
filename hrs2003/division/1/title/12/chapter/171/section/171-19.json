In the absence of any school building program in the district or in the event of any surplus remaining after the completion of buildings constructed pursuant to the approved plan then the proceeds or surplus shall be used in other departmental school districts in the county wherein the sales occur.\n\t(d)  When use of the fund is authorized by the legislature for the development of public lands for a particular project, to be disposed of by sale, lease, license, or permit, the board may pay from the fund the costs of the development, including the costs of surveys, construction of roads, water lines, sewer lines, and such other improvements as may be necessary for the development of the lands; provided that the project shall meet with the zoning and subdivision requirements of the appropriate county government in which the lands are located, except that plans and specifications for recreational projects, including access roads therefor, shall not be required to meet with such approval; and provided further that no such development of public lands for disposal by sale, lease, license, or permit shall be made unless appropriate roads, water lines, and other improvements are installed which will make the land usable for the purpose for which it is being disposed at the time of disposition.\n\t(e)  All unexpended and unencumbered moneys remaining on balance with the fund at the close of each fiscal year which are deemed, by the director of finance, to be in excess of the moneys necessary to carry out the purposes of this section over the next following fiscal year shall lapse to the credit of the state general fund.
