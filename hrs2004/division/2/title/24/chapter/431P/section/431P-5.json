Rates adopted shall be subject to approval by the commissioner pursuant to article 14 of chapter 431.  Rates adopted shall provide for classification of risks and shall include past and prospective losses and expense experience in this State;\n\t(4)\tAdopt procedures, guidelines, and surcharges applicable to policies of hurricane property insurance issued in connection with an underlying property policy issued by an unauthorized insurer;\n\t(5)\tAdopt any form of insurance policy necessary for providing policies of hurricane property insurance by the fund, with the approval of the commissioner;\n\t(6)\tIssue policies of hurricane property insurance and pay claims for coverage over the mandatory deductible or other deductible provided in the plan of operation or any manual of rules and rates adopted under the plan of operation;\n\t(7)\tRequire every licensed property and casualty insurer transacting direct property insurance business in this State to act as a servicing facility, and by contract with that insurer authorize the insurer to inspect eligible properties, service policies and policyholders of hurricane property insurance, provide claim services, and perform any other duties as authorized by the fund for applicants to the fund and those insured by it; \n\n\t(8)\t(A)\tAssess all licensed property and casualty insurers the amounts which, together with the other assets of the fund, are sufficient to meet all necessary obligations of the fund.  The assessment shall be made on the insurer's gross direct written premiums for property and casualty insurance in this State for the preceding calendar year.  The rate of assessment in a year in which a covered event has not occurred shall be 3.75 per cent and shall not include the insurer's gross direct written premiums for motor vehicle insurance in this State; provided that following a covered event, the rate of assessment may be increased to an amount not to exceed five per cent and may include the insurer's gross direct written premiums for motor vehicle insurance in this State.  This increase shall remain in effect until such time as all claims and other obligations, including but not limited to bonds and notes, arising out of a covered event shall have been fully discharged.  An insurer authorized to provide comparable coverage under section 431P-10(b) and which is providing hurricane property insurance in the State shall be assessed an amount that excludes gross direct written premiums for property insurance in this State.  The assessment for a year in which a covered event has not occurred shall be collected quarterly during each calendar year;\n\t\t(B)\tIn the event of a loss from a covered event the fund, in addition to the assessment in subparagraph (A), shall assess those insurers which acted as servicing facilities during the twelve months ending at the start of the month preceding the month in which the covered event occurs.  The total assessment shall be a fixed percentage of the total coverage provided by the fund under its policies of hurricane property insurance during the month preceding the month in which the covered event occurs.  The percentage to be used in calculating the total assessment shall be as follows:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tFor calendar year 1998, a percentage as fixed by the board in the plan of operation, but in no event shall the total assessment exceed $500,000,000;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tFor calendar year 1999, 1.125 per cent;\n\t\t\t(iii)\tFor calendar year 2000, 1.25 per cent; and\n\t\t\t(iv)\tFor calendar year 2001, and each calendar year thereafter, 1.5 per cent.\n\n\t\t\tA separate total assessment shall be made for each covered event.  The total assessment shall be allocated to each servicing facility based on the proportion of the total amount of the fund's gross direct written premiums for policies of hurricane property insurance serviced by each servicing facility to the total amount of the fund's gross direct written premiums for policies of hurricane property insurance, in each case, during the twelve months ending at the start of the month preceding the month in which the covered event occurs.  Assessments made under this subparagraph and those under subparagraph (A) in a year in which a covered event has occurred are due from each insurer based on assessment procedures established by the fund to meet its obligations to policyholders in a timely manner; and\n\t\t(C)\tThe fund may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any insurer if the assessment would cause the insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority in this State;\n\n\t(9)\tDevelop a program of incentives to encourage insurers to provide policies of hurricane property insurance in the event the commissioner authorizes the provision of comparable insurance pursuant to section 431P-10(b) which may include but are not limited to exemption of the insurer's gross direct written premium for property insurance from the assessment pursuant to paragraph (8)(A);\n\t(10)\tDevelop a credit based on the difference between premiums written in 1993 and the premiums written in 1992 by each property insurer against the assessment for gross direct written premiums written in 1993;\n\t(11)\tDevelop procedures regarding policies written by unauthorized insurers comparable to the assessments, surcharges, and other contributions made by insurers authorized to do business in this State;\n\t(12)\tAccumulate reserves or funds, including the investment income thereon, to be used for paying expenses, making or repaying loans or other obligations of the fund, providing loss mitigation incentives, and paying valid claims for covered events insured by the fund;\n\t(13)\tCollect and maintain statistical and other data as may be required by the commissioner;\n\t(14)\tExempt mortgage transactions from payments of the special mortgage recording fee and provide for maximum limits on or, uniform reduction of the special mortgage recording fee, pursuant to rules adopted by the board;\n\t(15)\tSuspend or reactivate the special mortgage recording fee pursuant to resolution of the board;\n\t(16)\tImpose fines for each incident of nonpayment of amounts due to the fund under this chapter; provided that the fines shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the amount then due; \n\t(17)\tCreate loss mitigation incentives, including but not limited to premium credits, premium rebates, loans, or cash payments;\n\t(18)\tEnter into claims financing transactions, including but not limited to reinsurance transactions, debt transactions, and other transactions incorporating elements of reinsurance, insurance, debt, or equity;\n\t(19)\tEstablish business and corporate entities or organizations pursuant to the purposes of this chapter; and\n\t(20)\tPerform any and all acts reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
