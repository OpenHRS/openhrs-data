[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7711-1109 TO 1110\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 When the Legislature adopted the Code in 1972, it declined to accept the Proposed Draft's treatment of the offense of cruelty to animals.\u00a0 Section 711-1109 as adopted clarifies the existing law relating to the offense of \"cruelty to animals.\"\u00a0 It makes it a crime to \"knowingly or recklessly\" overdrive, overload, torture, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, cruelly beat, or needlessly mutilate or kill any living creature.\u00a0 The section prohibits the keeping, using, management, or receipt of money for admission for fighting or baiting any \"bull, bear, dog, cock, or other creature.\"\u00a0 It also bars the carrying of any creature in a cruel or inhumane manner, and bars any other act towards the furtherance of any act of cruelty to animals. \n\u00a0 The section provides that if a domestic animal is so severely injured that there is no reasonable probability that its life or usefulness can be saved, the animal may be immediately destroyed. \n\u00a0 The section also states that the provisions do not apply to \"accepted veterinary practices\" and \"scientific research\" activities. \n\u00a0 Section 711-1110 is a new section which was not contained in the Proposed Draft.\u00a0 It authorizes agents of any society for the prevention of cruelty to animals to make arrests for violations of \u00a7711-1109. \n\u00a0 The Code basically retains the prior existing Hawaii law relating to this subject.\u00a0 Thus the provisions set forth in HRS Chapter 722, with updating, appear to be restated in substantial part in the Code.\u00a0 The Code treatment thus differs from the brief provision recommended by the Proposed Draft.\u00a0 The Legislature felt that the provision was too vague to prevent some types of mistreatment of animals.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972). \n\u00a0\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \u00a7\u00a7711-1109 TO 1110\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Act 173, Session Laws 1998, amended \u00a7711-1109 to provide that depriving pet animals of necessary sustenance constitutes the crime of cruelty to animals.\u00a0 The legislature noted that the statute identified only those acts which were the most heinous and extreme, such as beating, mutilation, poisoning, starvation, and torture.\u00a0 However, on a daily basis, other less overt acts such as daily neglect also resulted in the inhumane treatment of animals.\u00a0 Thus, the legislature agreed that pet animals deserved a minimum level of care including adequate food, water, and shelter.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 3222, Conference Committee Report No. 87.\n\u00a0 Act 192, Session Laws 1986, amended \u00a7711-1109 to provide that the intentional, knowing, or reckless poisoning of an animal, except insects and vermin, constitutes the offense of cruelty to animals.\u00a0 The prohibition was enacted in light of the increasing incidences of paraquat poisoning of animals and because of the uncertainty of whether the present law applied to such acts.\u00a0 House Conference Committee Report No. 37-86, Senate Conference Committee Report No. 27-86, and House Standing Committee Report No. 392. \n\u00a0 Section 711-1109.3 was added by Act 129, Session Laws 1983, to prohibit the practice of dog fighting and its related activities.\u00a0 While those activities could be prosecuted under \u00a7711-1109, the legislature felt the need to impose a more severe sanction than the misdemeanor penalty imposed in that section.\u00a0 Senate Standing Committee Report No. 347, House Standing Committee Report No. 1054.\n\u00a0 Act 259, Session Laws 2002, added \u00a7\u00a7711-1109.4 and 711-1109.5, creating criminal offenses for causing injury or death to a guide dog, signal dog, or service animal, and for intentional interference with the use of a guide dog, signal dog, or service animal.\u00a0 Act 259 recognized the unique skills of guide dogs, signal dogs, and service animals that have completed lengthy and specialized training to serve their owners with disabilities.\u00a0 The dogs have become the object of taunting and injury from people or from other dogs.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 58-02.\n\u00a0 Act 239, Session Laws 2006, added \u00a7\u00a7711-1109.1 and 711-1109.2, allowing:\u00a0 (1) law enforcement officers to enter premises and impound a pet animal when there is probable cause to believe the pet animal is being subjected to cruel treatment; and (2) a court to order the forfeiture of an impounded pet animal prior to the disposition of a criminal action against the pet animal's owner.\u00a0 The forfeiture was intended to pay for the animal's care, not to punish the owner.\u00a0 Act 239 provided a way to implement the legal principle that, despite the impoundment, the obligation to provide adequate care for the pet animal remains with the owner.\u00a0 Conference Committee Report No. 6-06, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2592.\n\u00a0 Act 114, Session Laws 2007, strengthened Hawaii's animal cruelty laws.\u00a0 Act 114 amended \u00a7711-1109 by making conduct against any animal resulting in substantial bodily injury a misdemeanor.\u00a0 Act 114 also amended \u00a7\u00a7711-1109.1 and 711-1109.2 by conforming the forfeiture provisions to apply to the felony prohibitions of the Act.\u00a0 Act 114 created the offense of cruelty to animals in the first degree, making it a felony to intentionally or knowingly torture, mutilate, or poison or cause the torture, mutilation, or poisoning of any pet animal resulting in serious bodily injury or death of the pet animal.\u00a0 The legislature found that violence, whether against humans or animals, must be not tolerated in our society. Evidence suggests a link between animal abuse and the commission of violent acts against humans.\u00a0 Hawaii is only one of nine states in the United States without a felony offense for domestic animal abuse.\u00a0 The legislature also found that pet animals provide a close emotional bond and relationship with their owners and family members and friends.\u00a0 Violence and harm committed against the animals have a significant emotional impact on their owners and family.\u00a0 The felony provisions of Act 114 protected pet animals.
