With the notice, the board:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tShall order the alleged violator or violators to submit a written schedule within thirty days specifying the measures to be taken and the time within which the measures shall be taken to bring that person into compliance with this chapter or any rule adopted thereunder.  The board shall accept or modify the submitted schedule within sixty days of receipt of the schedule.  Any schedule not acted upon after sixty days of receipt by the board shall be deemed accepted by the board;\n\t(2)\tShall order the alleged violator or violators to cease and desist from the activities that violate this chapter or any rule adopted thereunder, if that person does not submit a written schedule to the board within thirty days.  This order shall remain in effect until the board accepts the written schedule;\n\t(3)\tMay impose penalties as provided in section 6E-11.6; and\n\t(4)\tMay order the alleged violator or violators to appear before the board for a hearing to answer the charges issued, at a time and place specified in the notice or otherwise set by the board.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If the board determines that any person has violated an accepted schedule or an order issued pursuant to this section, the board shall impose penalties by sending a notice in writing, either by certified mail or by personal service to that person, describing such non-adherence or violation with reasonable particularity.\n\t(d)  Any order issued pursuant to this chapter shall become final, unless the person or persons named therein requests in writing, not later than twenty days after notice of violation and order is served, a hearing before the board.  Upon request for a hearing, the board shall require that the alleged violator or violators appear before the board for a hearing to answer the charges issued, at a time and place specified in the notice or otherwise set by the board.\n\tAny penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter shall become due and payable twenty days after the notice of penalty is served, unless the person or persons named therein requests in writing a hearing before the board.  Whenever a hearing is requested on any penalty imposed pursuant to this chapter, the penalty shall become due and payable only upon completion of all review proceedings and the issuance of a final order confirming the penalty in whole or in part. \n\t(e)  Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be conducted as a contested case under chapter 91.
