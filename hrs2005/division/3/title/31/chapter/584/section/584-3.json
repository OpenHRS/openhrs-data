[L 1975, c 66, pt of \u00a71]\n\n\n\n\nCase Notes\n  By their plain language, \u00a7584-1 and this section do not state that this chapter is the exclusive means by which paternity must be established; thus, this chapter is not the exclusive means by which a determination of paternity can be made.  99 H. 1, 52 P.3d 255."
