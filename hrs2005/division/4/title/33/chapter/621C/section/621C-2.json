The order may be issued prior to the assertion of the privilege against self- incrimination but shall not be effective until the witness asserts the witness' privilege against self-incrimination and the presiding officer communicates the order to the witness.  The application and order shall specify whether the immunity granted under this chapter is use immunity as set forth in section 621C-3 or transactional immunity as set forth in section 621C-4.
