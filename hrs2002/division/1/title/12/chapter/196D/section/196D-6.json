Each of these agencies shall designate an appropriate representative to serve on the interagency group as part of the representative's official responsibilities.  The interagency group shall perform liaison and assisting functions as required by this chapter and the department.  The department shall invite and encourage the appropriate federal agencies having jurisdiction over any aspect of the project to participate in the interagency group.\n\t(b)  The department and agencies shall cooperate with the federal agencies to the fullest extent possible to minimize duplication between and, where possible, promote consolidation of federal and state requirements.  To the fullest extent possible, this cooperation shall include, among other things, joint environmental impact statements with concurrent public review and processing at both levels of government.  Where federal law has requirements that are in addition to but not in conflict with state law requirements, the department and the agencies shall cooperate to the fullest extent possible in fulfilling their requirements so that all documents shall comply with all applicable laws.\n\t(c)  If the legislature establishes any public corporation or authority for the purposes of the project, then upon its establishment, the public corporation or authority shall be a member of the interagency group.
