As used in this paragraph, \"agreement of sale\" includes subagreement of sale or other subsequent subagreement of sale made on or after June 18, 1982.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this paragraph, with respect to any consumer credit agreement of sale made on or after July 1, 1985, upon extension at maturity or renegotiation thereof, the maximum rate of interest charged thereafter shall not be more than the greater of the rate of interest payable under the agreement of sale immediately prior to such maturity or renegotiation or four percentage points above the highest weekly average yield on United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of three years, as made available by the Federal Reserve Board within sixty days prior to the time of extension or renegotiation;\n\t(3)\tIndebtedness that is secured by a purchase-money junior mortgage lien on real property that is agreed to and incurred after June 18, 1982; provided that purchase-money junior mortgage lien means a mortgage that is subordinate in lien priority to an existing mortgage on the same real property that is given to the seller as part of the buyer's consideration for the purchase of real property and delivered at the same time that the real property is transferred as a simultaneous part of the transaction;\n\t(4)\tTransaction for the sale of goods, services, or both, by a seller in the business of selling such goods or services, if the transaction is subject to chapter 476 or the rate of interest charged by the seller in the transaction does not exceed eighteen per cent a year; provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any transaction regulated by chapter 412 or 431 or to any transaction for the sale of financial services.  This paragraph shall not be deemed to limit any seller's right to charge interest under section 478-2;\n\t(5)\tPayment of any claim under section 431:13-108; or\n\t(6)\tIndebtedness secured by a time share interest defined in [section] 514E-1, if that time share interest is not otherwise governed by section 478-8(a) or 478-8(b)(1) to (4), and if the rate of interest does not exceed eighteen per cent per year.
