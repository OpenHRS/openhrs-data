A lease having a stated term shall, if it otherwise comes within the meaning of the term \"lease,\" be deemed a lease notwithstanding any right of revocation, cancellation, or termination reserved therein or provided for thereby.  Whenever a lease is such that the highest and best use cannot be made of the property by the lessee, the measure of the tax imposed on such property pursuant to subdivisions (B) and (C) shall be its fee simple value upon consideration of the highest and best use which can be made of the property by the lessee.\n\t\t\tProvided further that real property belonging to the United States, even though not in the possession, use, and control of the State, shall be taxed on the fee simple value thereof, and private persons shall pay the taxes thereon and shall be deemed the \"owners\" thereof for the purposes of this chapter, in the following cases:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tProperty held on January\u00a01 preceding the tax year under an agreement for the conveyance of the same by the government to private persons shall be deemed fully taxable, the same as if the conveyance had been made, but the assessment thereof shall not impair and shall be so made as to not impair, any right, title, lien, or interest of the United States;\n\t\t\t(ii)\tProperty held under an agreement for the conveyance of the same or a conveyance of the same by the government, made after January\u00a01 preceding the tax year, shall be assessed as omitted property as provided in section 246-51, but the taxes thereon shall be prorated so as to require the payment of only so much of such taxes as is proportionate to the remainder of the tax year, and in the case of property held under an agreement for the conveyance of the same but not yet conveyed, the assessment thereof shall not impair, and shall be so made as to not impair, any right, title, lien, or interest of the United States;\n\n\n\n\t(2)\tReal property under lease to the State or any county under which lease the lessee is required to pay the taxes upon such property;\n\t(3)\tSubject to section 101-39(B), any real property in the possession of the State or any county which is the subject of eminent domain proceedings commenced for the acquisition of the fee simple estate in such land by the State or such county; provided the fact of such possession has been certified to the department of taxation as provided by section 101-36 or 101-38, or is certified not later than December 31 preceding the tax year for which such exemption is claimed;\n\t(4)\tReal property with respect to which the owner has granted to the State or any county thereof a right of entry and upon which the State or county has entered and taken possession under the authority of the right of entry with intention to acquire the fee simple estate therein and to devote the real property to public use; provided the State or county shall have, prior to December 31 preceding the tax year for which the exemption is claimed, certified to the appropriate tax official the date upon which it took possession;\n\t(5)\tAny portion of real property within the area upon which construction of buildings is restricted or prohibited and which is actually rendered useless and of no value to the owners thereof by virtue of any ordinance of any county, establishing setback lines thereon; provided that in order to secure the exemption the person claiming it shall annually file between December\u00a015 and December\u00a031 preceding the applicable tax year a sworn written statement with the tax assessor describing the real property in detail and setting forth the facts upon which exemption is claimed, together with a written agreement that in consideration of the exemption from taxes the person will not make use of the land in any way whatsoever during the ensuing year.
