[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-724; HRS \u00a7490:2-724]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\u00a0 To make market quotations admissible in evidence while providing for a challenge of the material by showing the circumstances of its preparation.\n\u00a0 No explicit provision as to the weight to be given to market quotations is contained in this section, but such quotations, in the absence of compelling challenge, offer an adequate basis for a verdict.\n\u00a0 Market quotations are made admissible when the price or value of goods traded \"in any established market\" is in issue.\u00a0 The reason of the section does not require that the market be closely organized in the manner of a produce exchange.\u00a0 It is sufficient if transactions in the commodity are frequent and open enough to make a market established by usage in which one price can be expected to affect another and in which an informed report of the range and trend of prices can be assumed to be reasonably accurate.\n\u00a0 This section does not in any way intend to limit or negate the application of similar rules of admissibility to other material, whether by action of the courts or by statute.\u00a0 The purpose of the present section is to assure a minimum of mercantile administration in this important situation and not to limit any liberalizing trend in modern law.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105."
