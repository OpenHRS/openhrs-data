[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-304; HRS \u00a7490:2-304]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 9, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 This section corrects the phrasing of the Uniform Sales Act so as to avoid misconstruction and produce greater accuracy in commercial result.\u00a0 While it continues the essential intent and purpose of the Uniform Sales Act it rejects any purely verbalistic construction in disregard of the underlying reason of the provisions.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Under subsection (1) the provisions of this Article are applicable to transactions where the \"price\" of goods is payable in something other than money.\u00a0 This does not mean, however, that this whole Article applies automatically and in its entirety simply because an agreed transfer of title to goods is not a gift.\u00a0 The basic purposes and reasons of the Article must always be considered in determining the applicability of any of its provisions.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (2) lays down the general principle that when goods are to be exchanged for realty, the provisions of this Article apply only to those aspects of the transaction which concern the transfer of title to goods but do not affect the transfer of the realty since the detailed regulation of various particular contracts which fall outside the scope of this Article is left to the courts and other legislation.\u00a0 However, the complexities of these situations may be such that each must be analyzed in the light of the underlying reasons in order to determine the applicable principles.\u00a0 Local statutes dealing with realty are not to be lightly disregarded or altered by language of this Article.\u00a0 In contrast, this Article declares definite policies in regard to certain matters legitimately within its scope though concerned with real property situations, and in those instances the provisions of this Article control.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 1-102.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Sections 1-102, 1-103, 1-104 and 2-107.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Money\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Party\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
