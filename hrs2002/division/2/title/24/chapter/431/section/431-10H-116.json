    "text": "(a)  Except as provided in subsection (b), a long-term care insurance policy shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this State unless the policyholder or certificate holder has been offered an option to purchase a policy or certificate that includes a nonforfeiture benefit.  The offer of a nonforfeiture benefit may be in the form of a rider that is attached to the policy.  If the policyholder or certificate holder declines the nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer shall provide a contingent benefit upon lapse that shall be available for a specified period of time following a substantial increase in premium rates. \t(b)  For a group long-term care insurance policy, the offer of a nonforfeiture benefit under subsection (a) shall be made to the group policyholder.  However, if the policy is issued as a group long-term care insurance, other than to a continuing care retirement community or other similar entity, the offering shall be made to each proposed certificate holder.\n\t(c)  The commissioner shall adopt rules to specify the type of nonforfeiture benefits to be offered as part of long-term care insurance policies or certificates, the standards for nonforfeiture benefits, and the rules for contingent benefit upon lapse, including a determination of the specified period of time during which a contingent benefit upon lapse shall be available and the substantial premium rate increase that triggers a contingent benefit upon lapse as provided in subsection (a).
