Supp. 1461.\n\u00a0 Defendant entitled to qualified immunity because it was not clearly established law at the time that it would violate plaintiff's procedural due process rights to wait seven days to petition family court for order ratifying emergency custody over plaintiff's children.\u00a0 949 F. Supp. 1461."
