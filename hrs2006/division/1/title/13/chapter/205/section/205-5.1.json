provided that within the urban, rural, and agricultural land use districts, direct use applications of geothermal resources are permitted both within and outside of areas designated as geothermal resource subzones pursuant to section 205-5.2 if such direct use applications are in conformance with all other applicable state and county land use regulations and are in conformance with this chapter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 The board of land and natural resources shall have the responsibility for designating areas as geothermal resource subzones as provided under section 205-5.2;
