The interest shall be allowed and paid at the rate of two-thirds of one per cent for each calendar month or fraction thereof, beginning with the first calendar day after the due date of the return or, if the return is filed after the prescribed due date, the first month following the month the return is received, and continuing until the date that the commissioner approves the refund voucher.  If the commissioner approves the refund voucher within ninety days from the due date or the date the return is received, whichever is later, and the comptroller of the State sends the taxpayer a refund warrant within forty-five days from the date of the commissioner's approval, no interest on the overpayment will be allowed or paid.  However, if either the commissioner or the comptroller exceeds the time allowed herein, interest will be computed from the first calendar day after the due date of the return or from the first month following the month the return is received by the commissioner if the return is filed after the prescribed due date, until the date that the comptroller sends the refund warrant to the taxpayer.\n\t(2)\tIf any overpayment of taxes results or arises from\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe taxpayer filing an amended return, or from\n\t\t(B)\tA determination made by the commissioner and such overpayment is not shown on the original return as filed by the taxpayer, interest on the overpayment shall be allowed and paid from the first calendar day after the due date of the original return or, if the original return is filed after the prescribed due date, the first month following the month the return is received, to the date that the commissioner signs the refund voucher.  If the comptroller does not send the refund warrant to the taxpayer within forty-five days after the commissioner's approval, interest will continue until the date that the comptroller sends the refund warrant to the taxpayer.\n\n\t(3)\tIn the case of credit, interest shall be allowed and paid from the first calendar day after the due date of the return, the first month following the month the return is received by the commissioner, or the date of payment, whichever is later, to the date the credit is taken; provided that the commissioner may make a refund of any credit to a taxpayer where the taxpayer has no underpayment against which to apply the credit.
