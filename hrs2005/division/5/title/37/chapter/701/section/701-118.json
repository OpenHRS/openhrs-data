The term \"peace officer\", as used in the Penal Code, caused the Intermediate Court of Appeals to question whether the term meant \"law enforcement officer\".  Act 91 resolved the ambiguity by providing a definition of \"law enforcement officer\" and substituting that term for \"peace officer\" [in the Penal Code].  Conference Committee Report No. 23.\n  Act 112, Session Laws 2005, established a statewide deoxyribonucleic acid database and data bank identification program for all convicted felons.  Conference Committee Report No. 184.  Act 112 amended this section by amending the definition of \"person,\" \"he,\" \"him,\" \"actor,\" and \"defendant\".\nCase Notes\n  A dolphin is not \"another\" within the meaning of paragraph (8).  1 H. App. 19, 613 P.2d 1328."
