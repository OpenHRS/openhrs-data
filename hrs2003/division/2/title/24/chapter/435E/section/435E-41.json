It shall be a false or misleading statement to state or represent that a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement is or constitutes \"insurance\" or an \"insurance company\" or an \"insurance policy\".\n\t(3)\tEntering into any agreement to commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in an unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, such cooperative corporations or interindemnity arrangements.\n\t(4)\tFiling with any supervisory or other public official, or making, publishing,

or placed before the public any false statement of financial conditions of such a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement with intent to deceive.\n\t(5)\tMaking any false entry in any book, report, or statement of such a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement with intent to deceive any agent or examiner lawfully appointed to examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or any public official to whom such a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement is required by law to report or who has authority by law to examine into its conditions or into any of its affairs, or, with like intent, wilfully omitting to make a true entry of any material fact pertaining to a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement in any book, report, or statement of a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement.\n\t(6)\tMaking or disseminating, or causing to be made or disseminated, before the public in this State, in any newspaper or other publication, or any other advertising device, or by public outcry or proclamation, or in any other manner or means whatever, whether directly or by implication, any statement that such a cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement is insured against insolvency, or otherwise protected by law.\n\t(7)\tKnowingly committing or performing with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice any of the following unfair claims settlement practices:\n\n\t\t(A)\tMisrepresenting to claimants pertinent facts or provisions relating to any coverage at issue.\n\t\t(B)\tFailing to

reasonably clear.\n\t\t(F)\tCompelling participating members to institute litigation to recover amounts due under an interindemnity arrangement by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in actions brought by such participating members when such participating members have made claims under such interindemnity arrangements for amounts reasonably similar to the amounts ultimately recovered.\n\t\t(G)\tAttempting to settle a claim by a participating member for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed he or she was entitled by reference to written or printed advertising material accompanying or made part of an application for membership in such an interindemnity arrangement.\n\t\t(H)\tAttempting to settle claims on the basis of an interindemnity arrangement which was altered without notice to the participating member.\n\t\t(I)\tFailing, after payment of a claim, to inform participating members, upon request by them, of the coverage under which payment has been made.\n\t\t(J)\tMaking known to claimants a practice of such cooperative corporation or interindemnity arrangement of appealing from arbitration awards in favor of claimants for the purpose of compelling them to accept settlements or compromises less than the amount awarded in arbitration.\n\t\t(K)\tDelaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring a claimant, or his or her physician, to submit a preliminary claim report, and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms, both of which submissions contain substantially the same information.\n\t\t(L)\tFailing to settle claims promptly, where liability has become apparent, under one portion of an interindemnity arrangement in order to influence settlements under other portions of the interindemnity arrangement.\n\t\t(M)\tFailing to provide promptly a reasonable explanation of the basis relied on in the interindemnity arrangement, in relation

attorney.\n\t\t(O)\tMisleading a claimant as to the applicable statute of limitations.
