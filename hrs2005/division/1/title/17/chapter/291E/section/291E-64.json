The counselor shall submit a report with recommendations to the court.  The court shall require the person to obtain appropriate treatment if the counselor's assessment establishes the person's alcohol abuse or dependence.  All costs for assessment and treatment shall be borne by the person or by the person's parent or guardian, if the person is under the age of eighteen.\n\t(e)  Notwithstanding section 831-3.2 or any other law to the contrary, a person convicted of a first-time violation under subsection (b)(1), who had no prior alcohol enforcement contacts, may apply to the court for an expungement order upon attaining the age of twenty-one, or thereafter, if the person has fulfilled the terms of the sentence imposed by the court and has had no subsequent alcohol or drug related enforcement contacts.\n\t(f)  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, whenever a court revokes a person's driver's license pursuant to this section, the examiner of drivers shall not grant to the person an application for a new driver's license for a period to be determined by the court.\n\t(g)  Any person sentenced under this section may be ordered to reimburse the county for the cost of any blood tests conducted pursuant to section 291E-11.
