Such convictions or bail forfeitures in such county, state, or territory of a violation therein which if committed in this State would be a violation of the traffic laws of this State or the ordinances of the several counties, shall be recorded against a driver the same as if the conviction or bail forfeiture had been made in the State.\n\t(c)  Reports of convictions by courts-martial or United States commissioners; recording against drivers.  Convictions by courts-martial of any of the various branches of the armed forces of the United States or by a United States commissioner of a violation either on or off government property which, if committed in this State, would be a violation of the traffic laws of this State or the ordinances of the several counties, may be recorded against a driver the same as if the conviction had been in the courts of this State.\n\t(d)  Upon determination and order by a district judge that a person has violated traffic laws of the State or ordinances of its counties with such frequency as to indicate a disrespect for such laws or ordinances and a disregard for the safety of other persons on the highways within a twelve-month period, the licensee shall report in person for a review of the licensee's driving record with the judge as directed by the judge if the licensee is present in court.
