The restraining order or order of protection shall specifically include a statement that possession or control of a firearm or ammunition by the person named in the order is prohibited.  Such person shall relinquish possession and control of any firearm and ammunition owned by that person to the police department of the appropriate county for safekeeping for the duration of the order or extension thereof.  In the case of an ex parte order, the affidavit or statement under oath that forms the basis for the order shall contain a statement of the facts that support a finding that the person to be restrained owns, intends to obtain, or possesses a firearm, and that the firearm may be used to threaten, injure, or abuse any person.

At the time of service of a restraining order involving firearms and ammunition issued by any court, the police officer may take custody of any and all firearms and ammunition in plain sight, those discovered pursuant to a consensual search, and those firearms surrendered by the person restrained.

Good cause consideration may include, but not be limited to, the protection and safety of the person to whom a restraining order is granted.\"\n\t(g)  Any person disqualified from ownership, possession, or control of firearms and ammunition under this section shall surrender or dispose of all firearms and ammunition in compliance with section 134-7.3.\n\t(h)  Any person violating subsection (a) or (b) shall be guilty of a class C felony; provided that any felon violating subsection (b) shall be guilty of a class B felony.
