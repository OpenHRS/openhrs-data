If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges that partner to be incompetent to manage that partner's person or property, the partner's legal representative may exercise all the partner's rights for the purpose of settling that partner's estate or administering that partner's property, including any power the partner had to give an assignee the right to become a limited partner.  If a partner is a corporation, trust, or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.
