No policy may be placed in force unless and until at least seventy-five per cent of the then eligible members of the association, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, have elected to be covered and have arranged for payment of their individual contributions to the association.\n\t(4)\tCharges collected from the insured members specifically for the insurance, and the dues of the association if they include the cost of insurance, may be determined according to each attained age or in not less than four reasonably spaced attained age groups.\n\t(5)\tThe policy must cover at least twenty-five persons at date of issue.\n\t(6)\tThe amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the association.
