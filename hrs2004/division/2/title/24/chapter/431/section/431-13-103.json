No insurer shall be deemed in violation of this section solely by reason of the numbers and types of such complaints except if the presumption under subsection (c) is not rebutted.\n\t(e)  If it is found, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that an insurer has violated this section, each instance of noncompliance may be treated as a separate violation of this section for the purposes of section 431:2-203. \n\t(f)  An insurer or licensee shall issue a written response with reasonable promptness, in no case more than fifteen working days, to any written inquiry made by the commissioner regarding a claim or consumer complaint.  The response shall be more than an acknowledgment that the commissioner's communication has been received, and shall adequately address the concerns stated in the communication.
