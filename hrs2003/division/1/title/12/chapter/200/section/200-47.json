    "name": "Disposition of proceeds",
    "number": "47",
    "text": "The department shall deposit that portion of the proceeds of the sale of a vessel as shall represent the mooring or other fees and charges due the department, the expenses of the auction, and any other expense incurred by the department in taking into custody and disposing of an abandoned vessel, into the boating special fund from which the expenses incurred in connection with the abandoned vessel, were paid.  The balance, if any, shall be deposited into the general fund of the State.  The owner may recover any such balance of the proceeds from the State only if the owner files a claim therefor with the department of budget and finance within one year after the execution of the bill of sale.  If no claim is made within the year allowed, the money shall become a state realization.  A lien holder shall receive priority in payment from the balance of the proceeds to the extent of the lien holder's lien on the vessel.  If the proceeds of the sale are insufficient to cover the mooring and other fees and charges, the expenses of the auction and the other expenses incurred by the department in taking into custody and disposing of the abandoned vessel, the department may bring an action for the deficiency in a court of appropriate jurisdiction against the registered owner or any person who had an interest in the vessel when custody was taken by the department. [L 1991, c 272, pt of \u00a72]"
