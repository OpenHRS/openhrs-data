Rev. 683.\nCase Notes\n  As to the description of the offense, this section, which relates to operating a vehicle after license and privilege have been suspended or revoked for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, substantially reenacted \u00a7291-4.5, which pertained to driving after license suspended or revoked for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor.  107 H. 36, 109 P.3d 677.\nDecisions under prior law (\u00a7291-4.5).\n  Section not violative of Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  26 F.3d 920.\n  Section is not constitutionally \"serious\"; thus, defendant not entitled to jury trial.  75 H. 68, 856 P.2d 1240.\n  Operating vehicle in private parking lot of nightclub was not upon the \"highways\" of the State and therefore not in violation of this section.  80 H. 47, 904 P.2d 932.\n  As there is no state of mind element for the offenses designated under this section or \u00a7291-4.4, pursuant to \u00a7702-204, these offenses are committed if the defendant acted with an intentional, knowing, or reckless state of mind.  95 H. 94, 19 P.3d 42.\n  Defendant had right of allocution before being sentenced for misdemeanor offense of driving with revoked license; denial of allocution, even where mandatory sentences must be imposed, was reversible error requiring resentencing.  77 H. 241 (App.), 883 P.2d 663.\n  State produced sufficient evidence to show that defendant acted with reckless mens rea with respect to the attendant circumstances of the driving while license suspended or revoked for driving under the influence offense; defendant's conscious disregard of the risk that defendant's license remained revoked or suspended for DUI-alcohol was a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the same situation.  106 H. 123 (App.), 102 P.3d 367."
