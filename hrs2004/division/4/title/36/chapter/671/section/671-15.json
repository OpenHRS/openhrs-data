    "text": "(a)  Within thirty days after the completion of a hearing, the medical claim conciliation panel shall file a written advisory decision with the insurance commissioner who shall thereupon mail copies to all parties concerned, their counsel, and the representative of each health care provider's liability insurance carrier authorized to act for such carrier, and the board of osteopathic examiners, as appropriate.  The insurance commissioner also shall mail copies of the advisory decision to the department of commerce and consumer affairs, if the claim is against a physician or surgeon licensed under chapter 453 or an osteopathic physician and surgeon licensed under chapter 460 or a podiatrist licensed under chapter 463E.  The panel shall decide the issue of liability and shall state its conclusions in substantially the following language:  \"We find the health care provider was actionably negligent in his or her care and treatment of the patient and we, therefore, find for the claimant\"; or \"We find the health care provider was not actionably negligent in his or her care and treatment of the patient and we, therefore, find for the health care provider\".\n\t(b)  After a finding of liability, the medical claim conciliation panel shall decide the amount of damages, if any, which should be awarded in the case.  The decision as to damages shall include in simple, concise terms a division as to which portion of the damages recommended are attributable to economic losses and which to noneconomic losses; provided the panel may not recommend punitive damages.\n\t(c)  The decisions shall be signed by all members of the medical claim conciliation panel; provided that any member of the panel may file a written concurring or dissenting opinion.\n\t(d)  The advisory decision required by this section need not be filed if the claim is settled or otherwise disposed of before the decision is written or filed.
