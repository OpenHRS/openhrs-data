A license or privilege to enter or remain in a building which is only partly open to the public is not a license or privilege to enter or remain in that part of the building which is not open to the public.  A person who enters or remains upon unimproved and apparently unused land, which is neither fenced nor otherwise enclosed in a manner designed to exclude intruders, does so with license and privilege unless notice against trespass is personally communicated to the person by the owner of the land or some other authorized person, or unless notice is given by posting in a conspicuous manner.\n\t\"Expired credit card\" means a credit card which is no longer valid because the term shown on the credit card has elapsed.\n\t\"Financial institution\" means a bank, trust company, insurance company, credit union, safety deposit company, savings and loan association, investment trust, or other organization held out to the public as a place of deposit of funds or medium of savings or collective investment.\n\t\"Government\" means the United States, or any state, county, municipality, or other political unit within territory belonging to the United States, or any department, agency, or subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any corporation or other association carrying out the functions of government, or any corporation or agency formed pursuant to interstate compact or international treaty.

As amended in 1974, \"building\" includes any structure, and the term also includes any vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft used for lodging of persons therein.\n  In explaining the change in 1974, the Senate Judiciary Committee in Standing Committee Report No. 1065-74 stated that it was clear the phrase, \"used for lodging of persons therein\" was added by Act 136, Session Laws 1973, \"to modify the terms 'vehicle, railway car, aircraft, or watercraft' and not the word 'structure.'  However, it is possible to interpret the present definition as including 'structures' only when 'used for lodging of persons therein.'  Such an interpretation means that stores, warehouses, and other commercial buildings not primarily used for the lodging of persons will not be included in the definition of 'building.'  As a further result, persons breaking into such places cannot be charged with burglary because the commission of that crime involves breaking into a 'building' as defined in (1).\"\n  Act 54, Session Laws 1992, amended this section by adding the definition of \"aquaculture product\" for the purpose of protecting Hawaii's aquaculture industry by deterring theft from aquaculture farms, which could cause devastating losses to research facilities and businesses.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1184-92, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1671.\n  Act 218, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products\".  The legislature sought to prevent the theft of agricultural equipment, supplies, or products by subjecting violators to a class C felony in \u00a7708-831.  Conference Committee Report No. 52.\n  Act 287, Session Laws 1993, amended this section by adding a definition for \"encoding\".  The legislature intended to provide criminal sanctions for the fraudulent encoding of a credit card in \u00a7708-8100.5.  Conference Committee Report No. 102.\n  Act 222, Session Laws 1996, amended this section by adding the definition of \"telecommunication service provider\" and by amending the definitions of \"telecommunication service\" and \"telecommunication service device\".  The Act was intended to expand the scope of the law establishing the offense of telecommunication service fraud, to include fraud involving cellular telephone devices and services.  The legislature recognized that cellular telephone fraud had become a major problem in the country, increasing consumer costs, and contributing to increased drug-related criminal activity, and that current state law did not provide comprehensive protection for telecommunication services theft.  House Standing Committee Report No. 1521-96, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2017.\n  Act 198, Session Laws 1997, expanded the definition of \"credit card\" to include electronic benefit transfer cards and debit cards, in order to criminalize the fraudulent use of debit and electronic benefit transfer cards under part X of chapter 708.  Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1547.\n  Act 45, Session Laws 2002, amended the definition of \"hotel\" to clarify that the definition in relation to offenses against property rights means a structure in which a majority of the tenants are roomers or boarders.  The current definition required all tenants to be roomers or boarders.  However, hotel structures will rarely be totally occupied by roomers or boarders at the exclusion of commercial tenants such as shops and restaurants.  The amended definition would more accurately reflect the current state of hotel operations.  House Standing Committee Report No. 176-02, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 2461.\n  Act 224, Session Laws 2002, amended this section by adding the definition of \"personal information\".  The legislature found that misappropriation of personal identification information was on the rise.  Act 224 addresses the criminal conduct associated with intentional identity theft.  Conference Committee Report No. 25-02.\n  Act 182, Session Laws 2005, amended the definition of \"agricultural equipment, supplies, or products\" by adding agricultural \"commodities\" in the definition.  Act 182 addressed the problem of agricultural theft in Hawaii by amending various provisions of Hawaii's theft laws relating to agricultural livestock and products.  Conference Committee Report No. 77, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 1359.\nCase Notes\n  Defendant did not intend to permanently deprive car dealership of vehicle where evidence indicated defendant wanted to have new vehicle to drive for weekend then return it when defendant's deception was discovered.  86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048.\n  Where defendant returned new vehicle after 72 hour possession and prosecution was unable to prove any economic loss to car dealership, no intent to deprive dealership of significant portion of vehicle's economic value, use, or benefit.  86 H. 207, 948 P.2d 1048.\n  Inasmuch as the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, as defined by this section, prescribes two alternative means of establishing the state of mind requisite to the offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, trial court plainly erred in failing to instruct jury as to the alternative states of mind requisite to the charged offense.  101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517.\n  The alternative states of mind potentially requisite to the charged offense of second degree theft by shoplifting, as prescribed by the definition of \"intent to defraud\" set forth in this section, does not implicate a defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, as guaranteed by article I, \u00a7\u00a75 and 14 of the Hawaii constitution; a proper elements instruction, which sets forth the alternative states of mind prescribed by the \"intent to defraud\" component of second degree theft by shoplifting, does not violate defendant's constitutional right.  101 H. 389, 69 P.3d 517.\n  Shambles and temporary absence not abandonment sufficient to deprive structure of use as a dwelling; a structure, although unoccupied does not become abandoned unless it is \"wholly forsaken or deserted;\" unoccupied house does not cease to be a \"dwelling\" because of the temporary absence of the owner.  2 H. App. 581, 637 P.2d 782.\n  Nightclub owner's bedroom and bath in separately secured area of club constituted a \"building\" within the meaning of this section.  9 H. App. 307, 837 P.2d 1308.\n  Once erected, a tent is a structure, and thus, a building.  9 H. App. 368, 842 P.2d 267.\n  In prosecution for first degree burglary under \u00a7708-810, prosecution satisfied its burden of proving that storage shed was in a garage that was part of a building that was a dwelling.  86 H. 143 (App.), 948 P.2d 564."
