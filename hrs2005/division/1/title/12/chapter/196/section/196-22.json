    "text": "State energy projects may be implemented under this chapter with the approval of the comptroller and the director of finance.  Notwithstanding section 36-41 or 196-21, the comptroller or the senior agency official of the department of accounting and general services, along with the director of finance, may exempt a state energy project from the advertising and competitive bidding requirements of section 36-41 or 196-21 and chapter 103, if the comptroller deems exemption appropriate for energy projects with proprietary technology or necessary to meet the goals of the legislature.  In addition, this section shall be construed to provide the greatest possible flexibility to agencies in structuring agreements entered into so that economic benefits and existing energy incentives may be used and maximized and financing and other costs to agencies may be minimized.  The specific terms of energy performance contracting under section 36-41 may be altered if deemed advantageous to the agency and approved by the director of finance and the senior agency official.
