Such complaint shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the board of appeals at a place therein fixed not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner, mortgagee, and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the board of appeals.\n\t(3)\tThat the board of appeals may administer oaths, affirmations, examine witnesses and receive evidence, and that if, after such notice and hearing, the board of appeals determines that the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human habitation it shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of the determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order which,\n\n\t\t(A)\tIf the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling (the ordinance of the county shall fix a certain percentage of the cost as being reasonable for the purpose), requires the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve the dwelling to render it fit for human habitation or to vacate and close the dwelling as a human habitation; or\n\t\t(B)\tIf the repair, alteration, or improvement of the dwelling cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the dwelling (the ordinance of the county shall fix a certain percentage of the cost as being reasonable for the purpose), requires the owner, within the time specified in the order, to remove or demolish the dwelling.\n\n\t(4)\tThat, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the dwelling, the public officer may cause the dwelling to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed.\n\t(5)\tThat, if the owner fails to comply with an order to remove or demolish the dwelling, the public officer may cause the dwelling to be removed or demolished.\n\t(6)\tThat the amount of the cost of the repairs, alterations, or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public officer shall be a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred.  If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer the public officer shall sell the materials of the dwelling and shall credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition and any balance remaining shall be deposited with the clerk of the circuit court of the circuit in which the county is situated, by the public officer, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by the court, and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of the court.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  An ordinance adopted by a county pursuant to this section shall provide that the public officer or the board of appeals may determine that a dwelling is unfit for human habitation if it is found that conditions in such dwelling which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety, or welfare of the occupants of such dwelling, the occupants of neighboring dwellings, or other residents of such county, or which have a blighting influence on properties in the area.

Hearings shall be held by the court on such petitions within twenty days, or as soon thereafter as possible, and shall be given preference over other matters on the court's calendar.  The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and shall enter a final order or decree in the proceeding.  In all the proceedings the findings of the board of appeals as to the facts, if supported by evidence shall be conclusive.  Costs shall be in the discretion of the court.
