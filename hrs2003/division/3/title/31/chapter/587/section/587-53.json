provided that upon the return the child and the child's family members who are parties shall be under the temporary family supervision of the department prior to the temporary foster custody hearing.\n\t(c)  The temporary foster custody hearing shall be continued for a period not to exceed fifteen days, if the court determines that it would be in the best interests of the child that further investigation be conducted and information concerning whether the child should remain in temporary foster custody be provided to the court by each of the parties, prior to rendering a determination as to whether the child should remain in temporary foster custody prior to an adjudication determination.\n\t(d)  During a continuance period ordered pursuant to subsection (c) or at any other time during the pendency of a child protective proceeding, the court may further order that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAny party undergo a physical, developmental, psychological, or psychiatric evaluation and that a written or oral report be submitted to the court and all parties prior to or upon the date of the continued or next hearing;\n\t(2)\tThe child's family members who are parties provide the department or other appropriate authorized agency with the names and addresses of other family and friends who may be potential visitation supervisors or foster parents for the child and that they arrange for the persons to appear in court upon the date of the continued or next hearing;\n\t(3)\tThe child's family members who are parties be permitted reasonable supervised or unsupervised visitation with the child at the discretion of the department or other appropriate authorized agency and the child's guardian ad litem;\n\t(4)\tThe parties, subject to their agreement unless jurisdiction has been established, meet with appropriate expert witnesses to discuss the alleged harm to the child;\n\t(5)\tThe court and the parties view a visual recording or listen to an oral recording of the child's statement at such time and in such manner as the court deems to be appropriate;\n\t(6)\tThe child and the child's family members who are parties, subject to their agreement unless jurisdiction has been established, arrange and commence participation in such counseling or therapy for themselves and the child as the court deems to be appropriate and consistent with the best interests of the child;\n\t(7)\tAn appropriate order of protection be entered;\n\t(8)\tA criminal history record check be conducted by the department or other appropriate authorized agency concerning a party who is an alleged perpetrator of imminent harm, harm, or threatened harm to the child, and that the results be submitted to the court and other parties in such manner as the court deems to be appropriate prior to or upon the date of the continued or next hearing;\n\t(9)\tThe department or other appropriate authorized agency prepare a written or oral supplemental report pursuant to section 587-40 and submit the report to the court, the guardian ad litem, and all parties prior to or upon the date of the continued or next hearing; or\n    (10)\tThe child's guardian ad litem visit the child's family home and foster home, be present during a supervised visitation, and prepare a written or oral report, including specific recommendations concerning services and assistance, to be submitted to the court and all parties prior to or upon the date of the continued or next hearing.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  The court shall consider all relevant prior and current information pertaining to the safe family home guidelines, as set forth in section 587-25 and the report or reports submitted pursuant to section 587-40, prior to rendering a determination in the temporary foster custody hearing.\n\t(f)  After a temporary foster custody hearing, if the court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that continued placement in foster care is necessary to protect the child from imminent harm, it shall order that the child continue in the temporary foster custody of the department under the terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, orders concerning services and assistance and which may be entered pursuant to subsection (d), as are deemed by the court to be in the best interests of the child; provided that prior to ordering placement or continued placement in any proceeding under this chapter the court first shall give due consideration to whether:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe removal or continued removal of the alleged potential perpetrator of the imminent harm, harm, or threatened harm from the child's family home prior to continuing or placing the child out of the family home.  The child's family shall have the burden of establishing that it is not in the best interests of the child that the alleged perpetrator be removed from the family's home rather than the child by order of the court; and\n\t(2)\tEvery reasonable effort has been or is being made to place siblings or psychologically bonded children together, unless the placement is not in the best interests of the children.\n\n\n\n\t(g)  After a temporary foster custody hearing, if the court determines that continued placement in foster care is not necessary to protect the child from imminent harm, it may order that the child immediately be released from temporary foster custody and returned to the child's family home with the assistance of services and under the other terms and conditions, including but not limited to, orders which may be entered pursuant to subsection (d), as are deemed by the court to be in the best interests of the child pending an adjudication or disposition hearing; provided that upon the return, the child and the child's family members who are parties shall be under the temporary family supervision of the department prior to an adjudication or dispositional determination.\n\t(h)  Any party may move for, or the court on its own motion may order, a temporary foster custody hearing or rehearing at any time after the petition is filed under this chapter in order to determine whether the best interests of the child require that the child be placed in temporary foster custody prior to an adjudication or dispositional determination.
