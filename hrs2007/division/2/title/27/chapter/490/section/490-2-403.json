Section 9, especially 9(2), Uniform Trust Receipts Act; Section 9, Uniform Conditional Sales Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0Changes:\u00a0 Consolidated and rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To gather together a series of prior uniform statutory provisions and the case-law thereunder and to state a unified and simplified policy on good faith purchase of goods.\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The basic policy of our law allowing transfer of such title as the transferor has is generally continued and expanded under subsection (1).\u00a0 In this respect the provisions of the section are applicable to a person taking by any form of \"purchase\" as defined by this Act. \u00a0Moreover the policy of this Act expressly providing for the application of supplementary general principles of law to sales transactions wherever appropriate joins with the present section to continue unimpaired all rights acquired under the law of agency or of apparent agency or ownership or other estoppel, whether based on statutory provisions or on case law principles.\u00a0 The section also leaves unimpaired the powers given to selling factors under the earlier Factors Acts.\u00a0 In addition subsection (1) provides specifically for the protection of the good faith purchaser for value in a number of specific situations which have been troublesome under prior law.\n\u00a0 On the other hand, the contract of purchase is of course limited by its own terms as in a case of pledge for a limited amount or of sale of a fractional interest in goods.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The many particular situations in which a buyer in ordinary course of business from a dealer has been protected against reservation of property or other hidden interest are gathered by subsections (2)-(4) into a single principle protecting persons who buy in ordinary course out of inventory.\u00a0 Consignors have no reason to complain, nor have lenders who hold a security interest in the inventory, since the very purpose of goods in inventory is to be turned into cash by sale.\n\u00a0 The principle is extended in subsection (3) to fit with the abolition of the old law of \"cash sale\" by subsection (1)(c).\u00a0 It is also freed from any technicalities depending on the extended law of larceny; such extension of the concept of theft to include trick, particular types of fraud, and the like is for the purpose of helping conviction of the offender; it has no proper application to the long-standing policy of civil protection of buyers from persons guilty of such trick or fraud.\u00a0 Finally, the policy is extended, in the interest of simplicity and sense, to any entrusting by a bailor; this is in consonance with the explicit provisions of Section 7-205 on the powers of a warehouseman who is also in the business of buying and selling fungible goods of the kind he warehouses.\u00a0 As to entrusting by a secured party, subsection (2) is limited by the more specific provisions of Section 9-307(1), which deny protection to a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The definition of \"buyer in ordinary course of business\" (Section 1-201) is effective here and preserves the essence of the healthy limitations engrafted by the case-law on the older statutes.\u00a0 The older loose concept of good faith and wide definition of value combined to create apparent good faith purchasers in many situations in which the result outraged common sense; the court's solution was to protect the original title especially by use of \"cash sale\" or of over-technical construction of the enabling clauses of the statutes.\u00a0 But such rulings then turned into limitations on the proper protection of buyers in the ordinary market.\u00a0 Section 1-201(9) cuts down the category of buyer in ordinary course in such fashion as to take care of the results of the cases, but with no price either in confusion or in injustice to proper dealings in the normal market.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Except as provided in subsection (1), the rights of purchasers other than buyers in ordinary course are left to the Articles on Secured Transactions, Documents of Title, and Bulk Sales.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Sections 1-103 and 1-201.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 1-201, 2-402, 7-205 and 9-307(1).\n\u00a0 Points 3 and 4:\u00a0 Sections 1-102, 1-201, 2-104, 2-707 and Articles 6, 7 and 9.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer in ordinary course of business\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Sections 1-201 and 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Person\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Purchaser\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Signed\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0\u00a0\"Term\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Value\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
