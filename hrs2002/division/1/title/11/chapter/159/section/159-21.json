The board may refuse to provide inspection to a new slaughtering establishment or may cause inspection to be temporarily suspended at a slaughtering establishment, if the board finds that any animal has been slaughtered or handled in connection with slaughter at such establishment by any method not in accordance with subsection (c), until the establishment furnishes assurances satisfactory to the board that all slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughter of animals is in accordance with a method specified in subsection (c).\n\t(c)  Either of the following two methods of slaughtering of animals and handling in connection with slaughter are found to be humane:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tBy rendering the animal insensible to pain by a single blow or gunshot or an electrical, chemical, or other means that is rapid and effective, before being shackled, hoisted, thrown, cast, or cut; or\n\t(2)\tBy slaughtering or handling in connection with slaughtering in accordance with the ritual requirements of the Jewish faith or any other religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter whereby the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  For the purposes of this section \"animals\" means cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines.
