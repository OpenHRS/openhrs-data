    "text": "(a)  On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or a member's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may order that the distributional interest of the judgment debtor be used to satisfy the judgment.  The court may appoint a receiver to carry out the provisions of the charging order.\n\t(b)  A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's distributional interest.  The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time.  A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.\n\t(c)  At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tBy the judgment debtor;\n\t(2)\tWith property other than the company's property, by one or more of the other members; or\n\t(3)\tWith the company's property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  This chapter does not affect a member's right under exemption laws with respect to the member's distributional interest in a limited liability company.\n\t(e)  This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company.
