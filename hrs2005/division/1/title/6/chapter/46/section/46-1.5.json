The authority provided by this paragraph shall not be self-executing, but shall become fully effective within a county only upon the enactment or adoption by the county of appropriate and particular laws, ordinances, or rules defining \"public nuisances\" with respect to each county's respective circumstances.  The counties shall provide the property owner with the opportunity to contest the summary action and to recover the owner's property;\n\t(13)\tEach county shall have the power to enact ordinances deemed necessary to protect health, life, and property, and to preserve the order and security of the county and its inhabitants on any subject or matter not inconsistent with, or tending to defeat, the intent of any state statute, provided also that the statute does not disclose an express or implied intent that the statute shall be exclusive or uniform throughout the State;\n\t(14)\tEach county shall have the power to make and enforce within the limits of the county all necessary ordinances covering:  all local police matters;

and\n\t\t(D)\tOpen, close, construct, or maintain county highways or charge toll on county highways; provided that all revenues received from a toll charge shall be used for the construction or maintenance of county highways;\n\n\t(20)\tEach county shall have the power to regulate the renting, subletting, and rental conditions of property for places of abode by ordinance;\n\t(21)\tUnless otherwise provided by law, each county shall have the power to establish by ordinance the order of succession of county officials in the event of a military or civil disaster;\n\t(22)\tEach county shall have the power to sue and be sued in its corporate name;\n\t(23)\tEach county shall have the power to establish and maintain waterworks and sewer works;

to take over from the State existing waterworks systems, including water rights, pipelines, and other appurtenances belonging thereto, and sewer systems, and to enlarge, develop, and improve the same;\n\n\t(24)\t(A)\tEach county may impose civil fines, in addition to criminal penalties, for any violation of county ordinances or rules after reasonable notice and requests to correct or cease the violation have been made upon the violator.  Any administratively imposed civil fine shall not be collected until after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91.  Any appeal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of the final written decision.  These proceedings shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine or injunctive relief ordered by the circuit court;\n\t\t(B)\tEach county by ordinance may provide for the addition of any unpaid civil fines, ordered by any court of competent jurisdiction, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of fees or charges for water for residential use and sewer charges collected by the county.  Each county by ordinance may also provide for the addition of any unpaid administratively imposed civil fines, which remain due after all judicial review rights under section 91-14 are exhausted, to any taxes, fees, or charges, with the exception of water for residential use and sewer charges, collected by the county.  The ordinance shall specify the administrative procedures for the addition of the unpaid civil fines to the eligible taxes, fees, or charges and may require hearings or other proceedings.  After addition of the unpaid civil fines to the taxes, fees, or charges, the unpaid civil fines shall not become a part of any taxes, fees, or charges.  The county by ordinance may condition the issuance or renewal of a license, approval, or permit for which a fee or charge is assessed, except for water for residential use and sewer charges, on payment of the unpaid civil fines.  Upon recordation of a notice of unpaid civil fines in the bureau of conveyances, the amount of the civil fines, including any increase in the amount of the fine which the county may assess, shall constitute a lien upon all real property or rights to real property belonging to any person liable for the unpaid civil fines.  The lien in favor of the county shall be subordinate to any lien in favor of any person recorded or registered prior to the recordation of the notice of unpaid civil fines and senior to any lien recorded or registered after the recordation of the notice.  The lien shall continue until the unpaid civil fines are paid in full or until a certificate of release or partial release of the lien, prepared by the county at the owner's expense, is recorded.  The notice of unpaid civil fines shall state the amount of the fine as of the date of the notice and maximum permissible daily increase of the fine.  The county shall not be required to include a social security number, state general excise taxpayer identification number, or federal employer identification number on the notice.  Recordation of the notice in the bureau of conveyances shall be deemed, at such time, for all purposes and without any further action, to procure a lien on land registered in land court under chapter 501.  After the unpaid civil fines are added to the taxes, fees, or charges as specified by county ordinance, the unpaid civil fines shall be deemed immediately due, owing and delinquent and may be collected in any lawful manner.  The procedure for collection of unpaid civil fines authorized in this paragraph shall be in addition to any other procedures for collection available to the State and county by law or rules of the courts;\n\t\t(C)\tEach county may impose civil fines upon any person who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county.  The fine may be up to $1,000 or may be equal to the actual cost of having the damaged property repaired or replaced.  The parent or guardian having custody of a minor who places graffiti on any real or personal property owned, managed, or maintained by the county shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor for any civil fines imposed hereunder.  Any such fine may be administratively imposed after an opportunity for a hearing under chapter 91, but such a proceeding shall not be a prerequisite for any civil fine ordered by any court.  As used in this subparagraph, \"graffiti\" means any unauthorized drawing, inscription, figure, or mark of any type intentionally created by paint, ink, chalk, dye, or similar substances;\n\t\t(D)\tAt the completion of an appeal in which the county's enforcement action is affirmed and upon correction of the violation if requested by the violator, the case will be reviewed by the county agency that imposed the civil fines to determine the appropriateness of the amount of the civil fines that accrued while the appeal proceedings were pending.  In its review of the amount of the accrued fines, the county agency may consider the following:  nature and egregiousness of the violation, duration of the violation, number of recurring and other similar violations, effort taken by the violator to correct the violation, degree of involvement in causing or continuing the violation, reasons for any delay in the completion of the appeal, and other extenuating circumstances.  The civil fine which is imposed by administrative order after this review is completed and the violation is corrected is subject to only judicial review, notwithstanding any provisions for administrative review in county charters;\n\t\t(E)\tAfter completion of a review of the amount of accrued civil fine by the county agency which imposed the fine, the amount of the civil fine determined appropriate, including both the initial civil fine and any accrued daily civil fine, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator.  If no review of the accrued civil fine is requested, the amount of the civil fine, not to exceed the total accrual of civil fine prior to correcting the violation, shall immediately become due and collectible following reasonable notice to the violator, at the completion of all appeal proceedings;\n\t\t(F)\tIf no county agency exists to conduct appeal proceedings for a particular civil fine action taken by the county, then one shall be established by ordinance before the county shall impose that civil fine;\n\n\t(25)\tAny law to the contrary notwithstanding, any county mayor may exempt by executive order donors, provider agencies, homeless facilities, and any other program for the homeless under chapter 201G from real property taxes, water and sewer development fees, rates collected for water supplied to consumers and for use of sewers, and any other county taxes, charges, or fees; provided that any county may enact ordinances to regulate and grant the exemptions granted by this paragraph;\n\t(26)\tAny county may establish a captive insurance company pursuant to article 19, chapter 431; and\n\t(27)\tEach county shall have the power to enact and enforce ordinances regulating towing operations.
