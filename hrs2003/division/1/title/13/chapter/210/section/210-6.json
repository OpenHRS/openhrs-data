For purposes of this subsection, the prime rate shall be determined on the first day of each month, and shall be the rate charged by the two largest banks in the State of Hawaii identified by the department of commerce and consumer affairs.  Should there be a difference in rate charged by the institutions, the lower of the two shall be used.
