The conditions specified by this subsection shall not apply to pensions paid under the federal Social Security Act or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, or the corresponding provisions of prior law.  Payments made under those Acts shall be treated solely in the manner specified by subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3). [L 1980, c 117, \u00a71; am L 1981, c 196, \u00a71]"
