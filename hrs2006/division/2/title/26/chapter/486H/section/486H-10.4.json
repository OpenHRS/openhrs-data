Rev. 549.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 The \"substantially advances\" formula announced in Agins v. City of Tiburon is not a valid method of identifying regulatory takings for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation.\u00a0 Since oil company claiming that the rent cap provision of Act 257 [L 1997 ((c))], on its face, effected a taking of its property argued only a \"substantially advances\" theory in support of its takings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment on that claim.\u00a0 544 U.S. 528."
