    "text": "In all cases of arrest for offenses that must be tried in the first instance before a jury, or that can be tried only on indictment by a grand jury, the judge in whose jurisdiction or on whose warrant the accused was arrested, upon the appearance of the accused, shall proceed to consider whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is charged.  The judge shall reduce to writing the substance of the evidence adduced, with the names of the witnesses.  If in the judge's opinion the testimony does not warrant commitment for trial, the judge shall release the prisoner, noting that fact upon the judge's docket.  But if in the judge's opinion there is probable cause to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense with which the accused is charged, the judge shall make out and deliver to a police officer a mittimus which may be in the form established by the usage and practice of the issuing court.
