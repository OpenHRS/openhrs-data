The respondent may regain the right to an administrative hearing by requesting the director, within sixty days of the issuance of the notice of administrative revocation as provided in section 291E-33, to schedule an administrative hearing.  The administrative hearing shall be scheduled to commence no later than thirty days after the request is received by the director.  The administrative review decision issued by the director under this section shall explain clearly the consequences of failure to request an administrative hearing and the procedure by which the respondent may regain the right to a hearing.
