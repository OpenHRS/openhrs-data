[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-510; HRS ]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\u00a0 To make clear that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Under subsection (1) the seller by his individual action cannot shift the risk of loss to the buyer unless his action conforms with all the conditions resting on him under the contract.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The \"cure\" of defective tenders contemplated by subsection (1) applies only to those situations in which the seller makes changes in goods already tendered, such as repair, partial substitution, sorting out from an improper mixture and the like since \"cure\" by repossession and new tender has no effect on the risk of loss of the goods originally tendered.\u00a0 The seller's privilege of cure does not shift the risk, however, until the cure is completed.\n\u00a0 Where defective documents are involved a cure of the defect by the seller or a waiver of the defects by the buyer will operate to shift the risk under this section.\u00a0 However, if the goods have been destroyed prior to the cure or the buyer is unaware of their destruction at the time he waives the defect in the documents, the risk of the loss must still be borne by the seller, for the risk shifts only at the time of cure, waiver of documentary defects or acceptance of the goods.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 In cases where there has been a breach of the contract, if the one in control of the goods is the aggrieved party, whatever loss or damage may prove to be uncovered by his insurance falls upon the contract breaker under subsections (2) and (3) rather than upon him.\u00a0 The word \"effective\" as applied to insurance coverage in those subsections is used to meet the case of supervening insolvency of the insurer.\u00a0 The \"deficiency\" referred to in the text means such deficiency in the insurance coverage as exists without subrogation.\u00a0 This section merely distributes the risk of loss as stated and is not intended to be disturbed by any subrogation of an insurer.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Section 2-509.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Conform\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103."
