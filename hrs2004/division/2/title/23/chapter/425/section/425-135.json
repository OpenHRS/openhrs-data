    "text": "(a)  A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation.  A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b). \t(b)  A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership within two years after the partner's dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under section 425-117 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tReasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner;\n\t(2)\tDid not have notice of the partner's dissociation; and\n\t(3)\tIs not deemed to have had knowledge under section 425-114(b) or notice under section 425-136(c).\n\n\n\n\t(c)  By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.\n\t(d)  A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.
