The federal financial institution shall comply with all requirements, conditions, and limitations imposed by federal law or regulation with respect to the merger or consolidation.  The Hawaii financial institution shall comply with all of the provisions of this chapter and chapter 414, except that the vote by shareholders or members of the Hawaii financial institution to approve the plan of merger or consolidation shall satisfy the requirements of section 412:3-604.  The resulting financial institution shall file with the director of commerce and consumer affairs a confirmation in writing by the commissioner of the date and time of the merger or consolidation, together with the appropriate filing fee pursuant to chapter 414.\n\t(d)  One or more financial institutions chartered or licensed under the laws of or whose operations are conducted principally in any state other than this State, in any possession or territory of the United States, or in any foreign country and one or more Hawaii depository financial institutions or trust companies may be merged or consolidated, but only where the depository financial institution or trust company resulting from any merger or consolidation pursuant to this subsection is chartered or licensed under the laws of and conducts its operations principally in this State, is a federal financial institution that conducts its operations principally in this State, or is an out-of-state bank authorized to establish interstate branches in this State pursuant to section 412:12-104.  A nondepository financial services loan company licensed pursuant to article 9 may be merged or consolidated with another corporation, but only where the nondepository financial institution resulting from any merger or consolidation is licensed under the laws of this State.  The financial institution chartered or licensed under the laws of any state other than this State, any possession or territory of the United States, or any foreign country shall comply with all requirements, conditions, and limitations imposed by the law of the jurisdiction under which the financial institution is chartered or licensed with respect to the merger or consolidation.  The Hawaii financial institution shall comply with all of the provisions of this chapter and chapter 414, except that the vote by shareholders or members of the Hawaii financial institution to approve the plan of merger or consolidation shall satisfy the requirements of section 412:3-604.  If the resulting institution is a Hawaii financial institution, the director of commerce and consumer affairs shall not file articles of merger or consolidation until the plan of merger or consolidation shall have been approved by the commissioner in writing.  If the resulting institution is a federal financial institution, the director of commerce and consumer affairs shall not file the articles of merger or consolidation until the plan of merger or consolidation shall have been approved by the commissioner in writing and the resulting federal financial institution shall file with the director of commerce and consumer affairs a confirmation in writing by the commissioner of the date and time of the merger or consolidation, together with the appropriate filing fee pursuant to chapter 414.\n\t(e)  A Hawaii mutual savings and loan association may merge into a Hawaii stock financial institution or a federal financial institution whose operations are principally conducted in this State, or may consolidate with a Hawaii stock financial institution or a federal financial institution whose operations are conducted principally in this State into a new resulting institution; provided that the resulting institution shall be a Hawaii stock financial institution or a federal financial institution, and shall not be a Hawaii mutual savings and loan association.  The merger or consolidation shall be effected pursuant to the procedures, conditions, and requirements for, and with the effect of, the merger or consolidation of two or more stock financial institutions pursuant to this section and to chapter 414, as though the Hawaii mutual savings and loan association was a stock financial institution; except that the members of the participating Hawaii mutual savings and loan association shall approve the plan of merger or consolidation at a meeting duly called and noticed and upon a vote which satisfies the requirements of sections 412:3-604 and 412:3-605.  If the resulting institution is a Hawaii financial institution, the director of commerce and consumer affairs shall not file articles of merger or consolidation until the plan of merger or consolidation shall have been approved by the commissioner in writing.  If the resulting institution is a federal financial institution, the resulting federal financial institution shall file with the director of commerce and consumer affairs a confirmation in writing by the commissioner of the date and time of the merger or consolidation, together with the appropriate filing fee pursuant to chapter 414.\n\t(f)  A Hawaii credit union may merge with a Hawaii credit union or federal credit union.  The merger shall be effected pursuant to the procedures, conditions, and requirements for, and with the effect of, the merger of two or more stock financial institutions pursuant to this section and to chapter 414, as though the credit unions were stock financial institutions; except that the plan of merger shall be approved by a majority of the members of the board of directors of each participating credit union and by the members of the participating credit unions at a meeting duly called and noticed and upon a vote which satisfies the requirements of sections 412:3-604 and 412:3-605.\n\t(g)  Prior to or after the vote of the shareholders or members upon the plan of merger or consolidation, but prior to delivery of articles of merger or consolidation and plan of merger or consolidation to the director of commerce and consumer affairs, the participating financial institutions shall file an application with the commissioner pursuant to section 412:3-603 for approval of the proposed merger or consolidation.  The application shall be accompanied by:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe plan of merger or consolidation;\n\t(2)\tA certificate signed by two executive officers of each of the participating institutions, verifying that the plan of merger or consolidation has been approved by the board of directors of the participating financial institution and that the attached copy of the resolution approving the proposed merger or consolidation is true and correct;\n\t(3)\tIf any participating financial institution is a federal financial institution or a financial institution chartered or licensed under the laws of any state other than this State, any possession or territory of the United States, or any foreign country, a certificate signed by two executive officers verifying that the financial institution has complied, or will comply with all federal laws and regulations or all laws and regulations of the jurisdiction under which it is chartered or licensed relating to the merger or consolidation;\n\t(4)\tIf the resulting financial institution is to be a Hawaii financial institution, the information required from applicants for approval to organize a Hawaii financial institution of the same type as the proposed resulting Hawaii financial institution;\n\t(5)\tIf a Hawaii financial institution is seeking to merge or consolidate with a financial institution of another type, the information required from applicants for approval to convert to another type of financial institution; and\n\t(6)\tAny other information that the commissioner may require.\n\n\n\n\t(h)  The commissioner may require notice to be given to the public as may seem appropriate.  The commissioner may conduct an examination of the institution as provided under article 2, part II.  The cost of any examination shall be assessed against and paid by the institution pursuant to section 412:2-105.\n\t(i)  The commissioner shall approve the plan of merger or consolidation if it appears that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAny resulting Hawaii financial institution would meet all the requirements under this chapter for a charter or license to the same extent that it would if it were applying for a new charter or license;\n\t(2)\tAny resulting financial institution would be adequately capitalized;\n\t(3)\tThe plan of merger or consolidation is fair to creditors and the shareholders or members of all participating institutions;\n\t(4)\tThe participating institutions have complied, or will comply, with all requirements, conditions, and limitations imposed by federal law or regulation or by the law or regulation of the jurisdiction under which an institution is chartered or licensed with respect to the merger or consolidation;\n\t(5)\tThe overall experience, moral character, or integrity of the proposed directors and executive officers of the resulting institution is consistent with the interests of the depositors, beneficiaries, creditors, shareholders, or members of the financial institution, or in the public interest;\n\t(6)\tThe merger or consolidation will not jeopardize the safety or soundness of any participating institutions or the resulting institution, and is not otherwise contrary to the public interest;\n\t(7)\tThe merger or consolidation will not substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or restraint of trade in any section of the country that includes this State or a part thereof, or that any anti-competitive effects are clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable effect of the merger or consolidation in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served;\n\t(8)\tThe merger or consolidation will promote the convenience, needs, and advantage of the general public particularly in the communities in which the participating and resulting financial institutions conduct or will conduct their business;\n\t(9)\tThe grounds for approval of a conversion to another type of financial institution pursuant to section 412:3-608 have been met in the case of a participating Hawaii financial institution seeking to merge or consolidate with a financial institution of a different type; and\n\t(10)\tThe plan meets any other criteria as the commissioner may deem appropriate.\n\n\n\n\t(j)  In the case of a merger, the charter or license of the participating depository financial institution or trust company which is the resulting institution shall continue as the charter or license of the resulting depository financial institution or trust company upon the effective date of the merger.  In the case of a consolidation, when the commissioner is satisfied that the participating depository financial institutions or trust companies have complied with all state and federal law with regard to the consolidation, the commissioner shall issue a charter or license to the consolidated resulting Hawaii depository financial institution or trust company.  A nondepository financial services loan company license may be issued to the resulting financial institution in conjunction with a merger or consolidation upon compliance with all applicable laws regarding the issuance of a license to a nondepository financial services loan company.
