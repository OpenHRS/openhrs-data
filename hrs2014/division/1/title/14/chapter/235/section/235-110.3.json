    "text": "(a)\u00a0 Each year during the credit period, there shall be allowed to each taxpayer subject to the taxes imposed by this chapter, an ethanol facility tax credit that shall be applied to the taxpayer's net income tax liability, if any, imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the credit is properly claimed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For each qualified ethanol production facility, the annual dollar amount of the ethanol facility tax credit during the eight-year period shall be equal to thirty per cent of its nameplate capacity if the nameplate capacity is greater than five hundred thousand but less than fifteen million gallons.\u00a0 A taxpayer may claim this credit for each qualifying ethanol facility; provided that:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 The claim for this credit by any taxpayer of a qualifying ethanol production facility shall not exceed one hundred per cent of the total of all investments made by the taxpayer in the qualifying ethanol production facility during the credit period;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 The qualifying ethanol production facility operated at a level of production of at least seventy-five per cent of its nameplate capacity on an annualized basis;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 The qualifying ethanol production facility is in production on or before January 1, 2017; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 No taxpayer that claims the credit under this section shall claim any other tax credit under this chapter for the same taxable year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 As used in this section:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Credit period\" means a maximum period of eight years beginning from the first taxable year in which the qualifying ethanol production facility begins production even if actual production is not at seventy-five per cent of nameplate capacity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Investment\" means a nonrefundable capital expenditure related to the development and construction of any qualifying ethanol production facility, including processing equipment, waste treatment systems, pipelines, and liquid storage tanks at the facility or remote locations, including expansions or modifications.\u00a0 Capital expenditures shall be those direct and certain indirect costs determined in accordance with section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code, relating to uniform capitalization costs, but shall not include expenses for compensation paid to officers of the taxpayer, pension and other related costs, rent for land, the costs of repairing and maintaining the equipment or facilities, training of operating personnel, utility costs during construction, property taxes, costs relating to negotiation of commercial agreements not related to development or construction, or service costs that can be identified specifically with a service department or function or that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of a service department or function.\u00a0 For the purposes of determining a capital expenditure under this section, the provisions of section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code shall apply as it read on March 1, 2004.\u00a0 For purposes of this section, investment excludes land costs and includes any investment for which the taxpayer is at risk, as that term is used in section 465 of the Internal Revenue Code (with respect to deductions limited to amount at risk).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Nameplate capacity\" means the qualifying ethanol production facility's production design capacity, in gallons of motor fuel grade ethanol per year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Net income tax liability\" means net income tax liability reduced by all other credits allowed under this chapter.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Qualifying ethanol production\" means ethanol produced from renewable, organic feedstocks, or waste materials, including municipal solid waste.\u00a0 All qualifying production shall be fermented, distilled, gasified, or produced by physical chemical conversion methods such as reformation and catalytic conversion and dehydrated at the facility.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Qualifying ethanol production facility\" or \"facility\" means a facility located in Hawaii which produces motor fuel grade ethanol meeting the minimum specifications by the American Society of Testing and Materials standard D-4806, as amended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (c)\u00a0 In the case of a taxable year in which the cumulative claims for the credit by the taxpayer of a qualifying ethanol production facility exceeds the cumulative investment made in the qualifying ethanol production facility by the taxpayer, only that portion that does not exceed the cumulative investment shall be claimed and allowed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (d)\u00a0 The department of business, economic development, and tourism shall:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 Maintain records of the total amount of investment

the cumulative amount of the tax credit during the credit period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon each determination, the department of business, economic development, and tourism shall issue a certificate to the taxpayer verifying the qualifying investment amounts, the credit amount certified for each taxable year, and the cumulative amount of the tax credit during the credit period.\u00a0 The taxpayer shall file the certificate with the taxpayer's tax return with the department of taxation.\u00a0 Notwithstanding the department of business, economic development, and tourism's certification authority under this section, the director of taxation may audit and adjust certification to conform to the facts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If in any year, the annual amount of certified credits reaches $12,000,000 in the aggregate, the department of business, economic development, and tourism shall immediately discontinue certifying credits and notify the department of taxation.\u00a0 In no instance shall the total amount of certified credits exceed $12,000,000 per year.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, this information shall be available for public inspection and dissemination under chapter 92F.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (e)\u00a0 If the credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's income tax liability, the excess of credit over liability shall be refunded to the taxpayer; provided that no refunds or payments on account of the tax credit allowed by this section shall be made for amounts less than $1.\u00a0 All claims for a credit under this section must be properly filed on or before the end of the twelfth month following the close of the taxable year for which the credit may be claimed.\u00a0 Failure to comply with the foregoing provision shall constitute a waiver of the right to claim the credit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (f)\u00a0 If a qualifying ethanol production facility or an interest therein is acquired by a taxpayer prior to the expiration of the credit period, the credit allowable under subsection (a) for any period after such acquisition shall be equal to the credit that would have been allowable under subsection (a) to the prior taxpayer had the taxpayer not disposed of the interest.\u00a0 If an interest is disposed of during any year for which the credit is allowable under subsection (a), the credit shall be allowable between the parties on the basis of the number of days during the year the interest was held by each taxpayer.\u00a0 In no case shall the credit allowed under subsection (a) be allowed after the expiration of the credit period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (g)\u00a0 Once the total nameplate capacities of qualifying ethanol production facilities built within the State reaches or exceeds a level of forty million gallons per year, credits under this section shall not be allowed for new ethanol production facilities.\u00a0 If a new facility's production capacity would cause the statewide ethanol production capacity to exceed forty million gallons per year, only the ethanol production capacity that does not exceed the statewide forty million gallon per year level shall be eligible for the credit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (h)\u00a0 Prior to construction of any new qualifying ethanol production facility, the taxpayer shall provide written notice of the taxpayer's intention to begin construction of a qualifying ethanol production facility.\u00a0 The information shall be provided to the department of taxation and the department of business, economic development,

anticipated production start date, and the taxpayer's contact information.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, this information shall be available for public inspection and dissemination under chapter 92F.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (i)\u00a0 The taxpayer shall provide written notice to the director of taxation and the director of business, economic development, and tourism within thirty days following the start of production.\u00a0 The notice shall include the production start date and expected ethanol fuel production for the next twenty-four months.\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, this information shall be available for public inspection and dissemination under chapter 92F.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (j)\u00a0 If a qualifying ethanol production facility fails to achieve an average annual production of at least seventy-five per cent of its nameplate capacity for two consecutive years, the stated capacity of that facility may be revised by the director of business, economic development, and tourism to reflect actual production for the purposes of determining statewide production capacity under subsection (g) and allowable credits for that facility under subsection (a).\u00a0 Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, this information shall be available for public inspection and dissemination under chapter 92F.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (k)\u00a0 Each calendar year during the credit period, the taxpayer shall provide information to the director of business, economic development, and tourism on the number of gallons of ethanol produced and sold during the previous calendar year, how much was sold in Hawaii versus overseas, feedstocks used for ethanol production, the number of employees of the facility, and the projected number of gallons of ethanol production for the succeeding year.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (l)\u00a0 In the case of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust, the tax credit allowable is for every qualifying ethanol production facility.\u00a0 The cost upon which the tax credit is computed shall be determined at the entity level.\u00a0 Distribution and share of credit shall be determined pursuant to section 235-110.7(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (m)\u00a0 Following each year in which a credit under this section has been claimed, the director of business,
