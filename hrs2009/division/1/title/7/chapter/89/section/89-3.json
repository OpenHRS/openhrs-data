Op. 74-6.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Strike found unlawful and therefore not a protected activity under this section.\u00a0 60 H. 361, 590 P.2d 993.\n\u00a0 Where plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that bargaining over pay dates was one of the core subjects of collective bargaining that triggers a violation of article XIII, \u00a72 of the Hawaii constitution, and failed to provide the supreme court with their collective bargaining agreement to support their contention that pay dates are bargainable, and these pay dates were not specifically incorporated into their contract, the Act 355, Session Laws of Hawaii 1997 amendment to \u00a778-13 to unilaterally alter the \"traditional practice\" of being paid on the fifteenth day and last day of the month did not violate their right to collectively bargain pay periods.\u00a0 111 H. 168, 140 P.3d 401.\n\u00a0 As \u00a784-13 prohibited the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building, and nothing in chapter 89 was explicitly contrary to, or inconsistent with, that construction, there was no conflict between \u00a784-13 and this section.\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.\n\u00a0 Where the posting of campaign materials on a union bulletin board on the fourth floor of a state building was prohibited by \u00a784-13, and was thus not lawful, the postings were not protected under the express language of this section (2006). 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324.\n\u00a0 Where the State, as employer, expressed a \"legitimate\" concern with campaign materials postings on the union bulletin board on the fourth floor of the department of transportation building, inasmuch as the supervisors at the department believed them to be in violation of \u00a784-13 and an ethics commission bulletin entitled \"Campaign Restrictions for State Officials and State Employees\", and there was no Hawaii labor relations board finding of \"union animus\", the removal of campaign materials from the union bulletin board did not infringe on the \"mutual aid or protection\" clause of this section (2006).\u00a0 116 H. 73, 170 P.3d 324."
