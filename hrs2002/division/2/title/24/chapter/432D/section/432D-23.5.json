    "text": "(a)  It is the intent of the legislature to recognize the application of telehealth as a reimbursable service by which an individual shall receive medical services from a health care provider without face-to-face contact with the provider.\n\t(b)  For the purposes of this section, \"telehealth\" means the use of telecommunications services, as defined in section 269-1, and enhanced services to deliver health and health care services and information to parties separated by distance.  Standard telephone, facsimile transmissions, or both in the absence of other integrated information and data, do not constitute telehealth services.\n\t(c)  From July 1, 1998, no health maintenance organization plan that is issued, amended, or renewed shall require face-to- face contact between a health care provider and a patient as a prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable professional community at the time the services were provided.  The coverage required in this section may be subject to all terms and conditions of the plan agreed upon among the enrollee or subscriber, the health maintenance organization, and the provider.
