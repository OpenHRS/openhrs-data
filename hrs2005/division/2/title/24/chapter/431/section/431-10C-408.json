No claim shall be assigned to any self-insurer for servicing.  Proration for insurers and self-insurers shall be founded upon a pro rata distribution for each premium dollar actually or theoretically received.  Self-insurers shall be assessed that prorated amount based upon the total premium cost for the coverage and vehicles stated in its certificate of self-insurance, as if the self-insurer had sold the coverage at the premium rates applicable under subpart C.\n\t(e)  If a person qualifies for assignment or benefits under this part, the joint underwriting plan or any insurer to whom the claim is assigned by the plan shall be subrogated to the rights of the person and shall have a claim for relief or a cause of action, separate from that of the persons, to the extent that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIt has paid personal injury protection benefits; and\n\t(2)\tElements of damage compensated for by the plan, with reference to the mandatory motor vehicle insurance or bodily injury policies and to the mandatory property damage policy for property damage sustained, are paid.
