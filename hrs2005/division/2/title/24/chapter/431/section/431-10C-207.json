    "text": "\u00a7431:10C-207    No insurer shall base any standard or rating plan, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, upon a person's race, creed, ethnic extraction, age, sex, length of driving experience, credit bureau rating, marital status, or physical handicap. [L 1987, c 347, pt of \u00a72]\nCase Notes\n  Section 431:10C-117 mandates that an insurer be fined if it violates this section, but gives the commissioner some discretion as to the amount of the fine; commissioner's imposition of $3,000 fine was not an abuse of discretion as it satisfied the statutory requirements.  104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196.\n  This section applies to both rating plans and standards, including underwriting standards; thus, commissioner and trial court correctly concluded that insurer improperly denied plaintiff's application for insurance.  104 H. 261, 88 P.3d 196."
