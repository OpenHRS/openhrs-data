    "text": "(1)  Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods \"ex-ship\" (which means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually discharged.\n\t(2) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed\n\n\n\n\t(a)\tThe seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and\n\t(b)\tThe risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-322; HRS ]"
