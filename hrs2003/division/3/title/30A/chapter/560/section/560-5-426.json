    "text": "Subject to the restrictions in section 560:5-408(4), the court may confer on a guardian of the property at the time of appointment or later, in addition to the powers conferred on the guardian by sections 560:5-424 and 560:5-425, any power which the court itself could exercise under sections 560:5-408(2) and 560:5-408(3).  The court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a guardian of the property otherwise conferred by sections 560:5-424 and 560:5-425, or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve the guardian of any limitation.  If the court limits any power conferred on the guardian of the property by section 560:5-424 or 560:5-425, the limitation shall be endorsed upon the guardian's letters of guardianship.
