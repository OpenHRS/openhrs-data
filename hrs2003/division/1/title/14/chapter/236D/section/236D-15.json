If no probate or administration proceedings have been taken out in any court of this State, the circuit court for the county in which the decedent was a resident, if the decedent was a domiciliary, or, if the decedent was a nondomiciliary, any court which has sufficient jurisdiction over the property of the decedent, the transfer of which is taxable, to issue probate or administration proceedings thereon, had the same been justified by the legal status of the property or had the same been applied for, shall have jurisdiction.  Any such court first acquiring jurisdiction shall retain the same to the exclusion of every other.  The tax appeal court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions in relation to the generation-skipping transfer tax arising under this chapter.\n\tAny person aggrieved by any assessment of the tax imposed by this chapter may appeal from the assessment to a court of competent jurisdiction within the time set forth in section 235-114; provided the tax so assessed shall have been paid.
