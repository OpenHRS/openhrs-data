Supp. 479.\n  As \u00a7607-14 does not expressly or obviously manifest an intent to be applied retroactively, the 1993 amendment did not apply retroactively to litigation terminated prior to the effective date of the amendment, July 1, 1993.  88 H. 46, 961 P.2d 611.\n  Retrospective law defined.  11 H. 404; 22 H. 96, 106; 42 H. 532, 535-6 (from standpoint of constitutionality); 33 H. 766, 774 (distinguishing between constitutional and unconstitutional retrospective laws).\n  It is a general rule that prospective operation is favored construction.  11 H. 600, 620, overruled on another point 11 H. 654, 658; 22 H. 96, 110; 28 H. 462, 467.\n  Law making sale or possession of opium illegal not retrospective though dealing in opium was formerly licensed.  3 H. 672; 3 H. 687.\n  Statute prescribing special rules of descent for land held under homestead agreement, inapplicable to existing agreement. 35 H. 550.\n  Repeal in 1859 of provision for reservation of mineral rights, no effect on existing rights.  49 H. 429, 443, 421 P.2d 570.\n  Statute clearly intended to cure defect in prior statute and confer benefit will be given retroactive operation.  34 H. 150, 158.\n  Income tax law expressly made effective on preceding January\u00a01, applies to income of calendar year last past.  33 H. 766.  Reduced tax rate expressly made retrospective applies to income of preceding calendar year.  21 H. 571.  Requirement of tax clearance as condition of county license, if deemed retrospective nevertheless not unconstitutional.  22 H. 96, 107.\n  New divorce law construed as inapplicable to pending cases, old law applicable.  3 H. 304.\n  Cutting down period allowed for suit against government so as to bar claims, not unconstitutional when prior statute did not provide for enforcement of judgment.  11 H. 404.\n  Statute providing that subsequent marriage revokes designation of beneficiary, applicable though the marriage already had occurred.  42 H. 532.
