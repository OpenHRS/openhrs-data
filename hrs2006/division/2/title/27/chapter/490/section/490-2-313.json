[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-313; HRS \u00a7490:2-313]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision: \u00a0Sections 12, 14 and 16, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\u00a0 To consolidate and systematize basic principles with the result that:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \"Express\" warranties rest on \"dickered\" aspects of the individual bargain, and go so clearly to the essence of that bargain that words of disclaimer in a form are repugnant to the basic dickered terms.\u00a0 \"Implied\" warranties rest so clearly on a common factual situation or set of conditions that no particular language or action is necessary to evidence them and they will arise in such a situation unless unmistakably negated.\n\u00a0 This section reverts to the older case law insofar as the warranties of description and sample are designated \"express\" rather than \"implied\".\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Although this section is limited in its scope and direct purpose to warranties made by the seller to the buyer as part of a contract for sale, the warranty sections of this Article are not designed in any way to disturb those lines of case law growth which have recognized that warranties need not be confined either to sales contracts or to the direct parties to such a contract.\u00a0 They may arise in other appropriate circumstances such as in the case of bailments for hire, whether such bailment is itself the main contract or is merely a supplying of containers under a contract for the sale of their contents.\u00a0 The provisions of Section 2-318 on third party beneficiaries expressly recognize this case law development within one particular area.\u00a0 Beyond that, the matter is left to the case law with the intention that the policies of this Act may offer useful guidance in dealing with further cases as they arise.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 The present section deals with affirmations of fact by the seller, descriptions of the goods or exhibitions of samples, exactly as any other part of a negotiation which ends in a contract is dealt with.\u00a0 No specific intention to make a warranty is necessary if any of these factors is made part of the basis of the bargain.\u00a0 In actual practice affirmations of fact made by the seller about the goods during a bargain are regarded as part of the description of those goods; hence no particular reliance on such statements need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement.\u00a0 Rather, any fact which is to take such affirmations, once made, out of the agreement requires clear affirmative proof.\u00a0 The issue normally is one of fact.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 In view of the principle that the whole purpose of the law of warranty is to determine what it is that the seller has in essence agreed to sell, the policy is adopted of those cases which refuse except in unusual circumstances to recognize a material deletion of the seller's obligation.\u00a0 Thus, a contract is normally a contract for a sale of something describable and described.\u00a0 A clause generally disclaiming \"all warranties, express or implied\" cannot reduce the seller's obligation with respect to such description and therefore cannot be given literal effect under Section 2-316.\n\u00a0 This is not intended to mean that the parties, if they consciously desire, cannot make their own bargain as they wish.\u00a0 But in determining what they have agreed upon good faith is a factor and consideration should be given to the fact that the probability is small that a real price is intended to be exchanged for a pseudo-obligation.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Paragraph (1)(b) makes specific some of the principles set forth above when a description of the goods is given by the seller.\n\u00a0 A description need not be by words.\u00a0 Technical specifications, blueprints and the like can afford more exact description than mere language and if made part of the basis of the bargain goods must conform with them.\u00a0 Past deliveries may set the description of quality, either expressly or impliedly by course of dealing.\u00a0 Of course, all descriptions by merchants must be read against the applicable trade usages with the general rules as to merchantability resolving any doubts.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 The basic situation as to statements affecting the true essence of the bargain is no different when a sample or model is involved in the transaction.\u00a0 This section includes both a \"sample\" actually drawn from the bulk of goods which is the subject matter of the sale, and a \"model\" which is offered for inspection when the subject matter is not at hand and which has not been drawn from the bulk of the goods.\n\u00a0 Although the underlying principles are unchanged, the facts are often ambiguous when something is shown as illustrative, rather than as a straight sample.\u00a0 In general, the presumption is that any sample or model just as any affirmation of fact is intended to become a basis of the bargain.\u00a0 But there is no escape from the question of fact.\u00a0 When the seller exhibits a sample purporting to be drawn from an existing bulk, good faith of course requires that the sample be fairly drawn.\u00a0 But in mercantile experience the mere exhibition of a \"sample\" does not of itself show whether it is merely intended to \"suggest\" or to \"be\" the character of the subject matter of the contract.\u00a0 The question is whether the seller has so acted with reference to the sample as to make him responsible that the whole shall have at least the values shown by it.\u00a0 The circumstances aid in answering this question.\u00a0 If the sample has been drawn from an existing bulk, it must be regarded as describing values of the goods contracted for unless it is accompanied by an unmistakable denial of such responsibility.\u00a0 If, on the other hand, a model of merchandise not on hand is offered, the mercantile presumption that it has become a literal description of the subject matter is not so strong, and particularly so if modification on the buyer's initiative impairs any feature of the model.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 The precise time when words of description or affirmation are made or samples are shown is not material.\u00a0 The sole question is whether the language or samples or models are fairly to be regarded as part of the contract.\u00a0 If language is used after the closing of the deal (as when the buyer when taking delivery asks and receives an additional assurance), the warranty becomes a modification, and need not be supported by consideration if it is otherwise reasonable and in order (Section 2-209).\n\u00a0 8.\u00a0 Concerning affirmations of value or a seller's opinion or commendation under subsection (2), the basic question remains the same:\u00a0 What statements of the seller have in the circumstances and in objective judgment become part of the basis of the bargain?\u00a0 As indicated above, all of the statements of the seller do so unless good reason is shown to the contrary.\u00a0 The provisions of subsection (2) are included, however, since common experience discloses that some statements or predictions cannot fairly be viewed as entering into the bargain.\u00a0 Even as to false statements of value, however, the possibility is left open that a remedy may be provided by the law relating to fraud or misrepresentation.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 2-316.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 1-102(3) and 2-318.\n\u00a0

warranty on the artwork.\u00a0 745 F. Supp. 1556.\n\u00a0 A breach of express warranty action could be a basis for a derivative wrongful death action brought pursuant to \u00a7663-3.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0 Reliance is not an essential element of a breach of express warranty claim under the UCC.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0 Seller's contractual description of crane as being equipped with 30-inch-wide treads was part of basis of bargain with buyer, and constituted an express warranty which seller breached when it delivered crane with 24-inch-wide treads.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0 Under the UCC, a seller's statements to a buyer regarding goods sold, made during the bargaining process, are presumptively part of the basis of the bargain between seller and buyer; thus burden is on seller to prove that resulting bargain did not rest at all on seller's statements.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004.\n\u00a0 Where no evidence that advertisements were given to buyer as part of bargaining process, were part of contract documents, or that buyer read or was even aware of advertisements, advertisements did not become part of basis of the bargain amounting to an express warranty.\u00a0 86 H. 383 (App.), 949 P.2d 1004."
