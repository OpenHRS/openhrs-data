Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no exclusive representative of a bargaining unit that sponsors or participates in a voluntary employee beneficiary association shall be eligible to select nominees or to be represented by a trustee on the board.\n\tAs used in this section, the term \"exclusive representative\" shall have the same meaning as in section 89-2. [L 2001, c 88, pt of \u00a71; am L 2005, c 250, \u00a71]\nExplanatory Note\n  L 2005, c 250 amendment.  The legislature concluded that the governor's proclamation indicating the governor's intent to return H.B. No. 1548 was constitutionally defective and that said measure became law.  On July 13, 2005, the legislature assigned Act 250 to H.B. No. 1548.  The attorney general has taken the position that H.B. No. 1548 did not become law."
