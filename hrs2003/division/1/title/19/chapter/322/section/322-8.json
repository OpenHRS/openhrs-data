    "text": "(a)  Any person who violates this part or any rule adopted by the department of health to implement this part shall be fined not more than $10,000 for each separate offense.  Any action taken to collect the penalty provided for in this subsection shall be considered a civil action. \t(b)  The director of health may impose by order the administrative penalty specified in this section.  Factors to be considered in imposing the administrative penalty include the nature and history of the violation and of any prior violation, and the opportunity, difficulty, and history of corrective action.  It is presumed that the violator's economic and financial conditions allow payment of the penalty and the burden of proof to the contrary is on the violator.  For any judicial proceeding to recover the administrative penalty imposed, the director of health need only show that notice was given, a hearing was held, or the time granted for requesting a hearing has expired without such a request, the administrative penalty was imposed, and that the penalty remains unpaid.\n\t(c)  In addition to the penalty under subsection (a), the director of health may order the person who has committed the violation to correct the violation at the person's own expense.
