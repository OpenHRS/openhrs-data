The existence and scope of a usage of trade shall be proved as facts.  If it is established that the usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.\n\t(d)  A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.\n\t(e)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is unreasonable:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tExpress terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade;\n\t(2)\tCourse of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and\n\t(3)\tCourse of dealing prevails over usage of trade.\n\n\n\n\t(f)  Subject to section 490:2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.\n\t(g)  Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.
