Upon receipt of the certification, the licensing authority shall suspend any license that the obligor or individual holds or deny any license for which the obligor or individual applies without further review or hearing concerning the suspension, nonrenewal, nonreinstatement, nonrestoration, or denial.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law setting terms of suspension, revocation, denial, termination, or renewal, reinstatement, or restoration of a license, a certification issued by the agency suspending, not renewing, not reinstating, not restoring, or denying a license shall be implemented by the licensing authority and continue in effect until the licensing authority receives a written release of suspension or denial from the agency, the office of child support hearings, or the family court.\n\n\n\n\t(d)  The obligor may enter into a payment agreement with the agency if the obligor makes contact with the agency within thirty days of the date of service of the notice, or the individual may enter into an agreement to provide the information requested in the subpoena or appear at the proceeding required by the warrant.\n\t(e)  If the obligor or the individual requests an administrative hearing in writing within thirty days of the date of service of the notice as provided in subsection (b), the office shall schedule a hearing to determine whether the obligor is not in compliance with a support order or whether the individual is not in compliance with a subpoena or warrant relating to a paternity or child support proceeding.
