[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  The purpose of this section is to penalize corruption of publicly-exhibited contests.  It represents a broadening of previous legislation penalizing sports bribery and tampering.  Note that publicly-exhibited contest includes, by definition in subsection (2)(a), not only sporting events, but also non- athletic contests, such as quiz shows.  In addition to the possibilities of wholesale fraud, there is a substantial element of public affront at rigging or tampering with the outcome of publicly-exhibited contests:  witness the quiz show scandals of the last decade.  Moreover, it is felt that such behavior should be deterred because it \"subjects legitimate entertainment and advertising to unfair and debasing competition.\"[1]  The last part of subsection (2)(a) provides an exception for exhibitions, such as some wrestling spectacles, which do not purport to be and are not represented as being a sport, contest, game or race.\n  Subsection (1)(a) defines the offense in terms of the bribe offeror's conduct, whether it be addressed to the contest participant or the contest official.  Subsection (1)(b) defines the offense in terms of the bribe solicitor or receiver.  Finally, subsection (1)(c) is addressed to corruption, not by bribery, but by improper meddling or clandestine substitution. \n  Previous Hawaii law recognized the offense of bribery involving participants and officials in professional or amateur sports contests.[2]  The sanction provided seems unduly severe; it is roughly equivalent to the Code's sentence for a class C felony.  The Code clarifies the language of the offense, broadens its scope, and reduces the available sanction to a misdemeanor. \n__________\n Commentary:\n1.

H.R.S. \u00a7725-7. \nNote on Ticket Scalping, Fortune Telling,\nSorcery, and Allied Practices\n  Some recent penal revisions have continued to make it an offense to scalp tickets.[1]  The offense covers issuing or selling tickets:  (1) without the price or seat, if any, printed conspicuously on them, (2) for more than the price printed on the ticket or charged at the place of admission, or (3) in violation of a condition making the tickets \"nontransferable.\"[2]  Hawaii previously had a law which covered the second mode of ticket scalping.[3]  The Model Penal Code does not make such activity an offense and any justification for a penal sanction does not readily appear.  The potential harm which could result from the issuing or selling of tickets in blank form is adequately covered by the sections on theft by deception and complicity. \n  Fortune telling has also been made an offense in some codes.[4]  Hawaii law previously had such a provision.[5]  Again, it is hard to see why this activity should be made a penal offense per se.  If the activity amounts, under aggravated circumstances, to theft by deception, the theft sections can be employed.  The argument in favor of making fortune telling an offense has been stated by the Michigan revision: \n\n\t\tThere may be some question whether this conduct should continue to be criminal.  However, persons holding themselves out to possess occult powers very often proceed to take advantage of the gullible and persuade them to turn over money or property.  While this activity amounts to theft by deception [citing section], it may be difficult to prove.  A prohibition against fortune telling, etc., as such drives the activity underground and reduces somewhat the opportunity to practice frauds.[6]  \n\n  In view of the coverage by the offense of theft, the utility to be gained from driving the activity underground seems marginal.  Indeed, driving the activity underground would reduce the opportunity to discover and prove theft by deception which arises in this context. \n  Hawaii law previously contained a section making sorcery an offense.[7]  Since the section is based on using pretended power to cure another, rather than intent to defraud that person, the practice seems adequately covered and penalized as practicing medicine without a license.[8] \n  For these reasons, the Code intentionally omits provisions making ticket scalping, fortune telling, and sorcery penal offenses. \n__________\nNote on Ticket Scalping, Fortune Telling, Sorcery, and Allied Practices\n1.
