    "text": "(a)  The terms \"guaranteed renewable\" and \"noncancellable\" shall not be used in any individual long-term care insurance policy without further explanatory language in accordance with the disclosure requirements of section 431:10H-211.  A policy issued to an individual shall not contain renewal provisions other than guaranteed renewable or noncancellable. \t(b)  The term \"guaranteed renewable\" may be used only when the insured has the right to continue the long-term care insurance in force by the timely payment of premiums and when the insurer has no unilateral right to make any change in any provision of the policy or rider while the insurance is in force, and cannot decline to renew, except that rates may be revised by the insurer on a class basis.\n\t(c)  The term \"noncancellable\" means the insured has the right to continue the long-term care insurance in force by the timely payment of premiums during which period the insurer has no right to unilaterally make any change in any provision of the insurance or in the premium rate.
