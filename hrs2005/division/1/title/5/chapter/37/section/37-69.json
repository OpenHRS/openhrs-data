Att. Gen. Op. 83-4.\n  Although express words \"balanced budget\" are not included in state constitution or statutes relating to state budget, constitutional and statutory provisions do require a balanced budget by requiring a description of proposed expenditures and sources of revenue to pay for them.  Att. Gen. Op. 97-1.\n  Using historical data to make estimates for a future fiscal period is an acceptable planning tool.  Att. Gen. Op. 03-2."
