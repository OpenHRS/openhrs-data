    "text": "When the plaintiff desires the immediate delivery of the property, the plaintiff shall execute a bond to the defendant in possession of the property, and to all persons having an interest in the property, of such amount and with such sureties as are approved by the court, conditioned that the plaintiff will prosecute the plaintiff's action to judgment without delay, and deliver the property to the defendant in possession or any other person, if such delivery is adjudged, and pay all costs and damages that may be adjudged against the plaintiff.  Upon the filing of the verified complaint or affidavit with the bond and a motion for immediate consideration of the matter, the court shall forthwith inquire into the matter, ex parte or otherwise, as in its discretion it determines.  If thereupon the court finds that a prima facie claim for relief has been established, it shall issue an order directed to the sheriff, or the sheriff's deputy, or the chief of police, or an authorized police officer of any county, or a person authorized by the rules of court, to take the property therein described and deliver the same to the plaintiff.\n\tCopies of the verified complaint or affidavit, and, if a bond for immediate seizure has been filed, of the bond, and, if an order for the taking has been issued on an ex parte hearing, of the order, shall forthwith be served upon the defendant in possession and each person having or claiming a possessory interest in the property, in the same manner as is provided for service of summons unless the party to be served has appeared in the action, in which case service may be made in the same manner as is provided for service of papers other than the summons.  In a proper case, either before or after issuance of an order for the taking, the required service may be combined with the publication of the summons, in which event the giving of notice of the substance of the proceeding shall be sufficient.\n\tUpon the application of any party, the proceeding shall be advanced and assigned for hearing at the earliest possible date.
