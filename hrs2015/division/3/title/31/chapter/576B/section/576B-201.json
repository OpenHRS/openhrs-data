[L 1997, c 295, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 As Hawaii retains its continuing jurisdiction to enforce a child support order as long as the order has not been modified by a tribunal of another state pursuant to chapter 576B or a law substantially similar to it, this section authorized the family court to enforce the child support order even though the father, mother, and children were no longer residents of this State.\u00a0 98 H. 168 (App.), 45 P.3d 368.\n\u00a0 Where family court had neither general nor specific jurisdiction over father, court erred in entering default judgment against father in mother's child support action.\u00a0 110 H. 294 (App.), 132 P.3d 862 (2006)."
