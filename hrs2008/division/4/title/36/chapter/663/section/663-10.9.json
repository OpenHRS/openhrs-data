Rev. 575.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 State properly held jointly and severally liable under paragraph (4) as a \"prior occurrence\" need not be identical or exactly similar to put State on \"reasonable prior notice\"; it was enough that the State knew of the particular defective guardrail, had an opportunity to correct it, and failed to do so.\u00a0 91 H. 60, 979 P.2d 1086.\n\u00a0 Section 663-10.5, which abolishes joint and several liability for government entities, did not supersede or impliedly repeal (1) paragraph (4), which expressly allows for recovery of non-economic damages in motor vehicle accidents involving the maintenance and design of highways, or (2) paragraph (1), that provides for the recovery of economic damages against joint tortfeasors in actions involving injury or death to persons.\u00a0 110 H. 97, 129 P.3d 1125.\n\u00a0 Plaintiffs' negligence claim included the right to recover under an unmodified doctrine of joint and several liability, as at the time their claim accrued, \u00a7663-10.5 (2005) imposed joint and several liability for economic and noneconomic damages upon any jointly liable person; thus, because the legislature did not intend for Act 112, L 2006 to apply retroactively to divest the plaintiffs\u0092 accrued or substantive rights, the trial court correctly concluded that Act 112 did not apply to the case.\u00a0 117 H. 262, 178 P.3d 538.\n\u00a0 Section does not abolish joint and several liability for actions involving intentional torts; condominium association and murderer were thus jointly and severally liable to plaintiffs for noneconomic as well as economic damages, subject to reduction proportional to victim's assigned negligence.\u00a0 87 H. 273 (App.), 954 P.2d 652.\n\u00a0\nPrior law.\n\u00a0 Joint and several liability imposed on asbestos manufacturers in products liability action.\u00a0 960 F.2d 806."
