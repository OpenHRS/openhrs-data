The claim shall be filed within thirty days after the return of the property or after the governor proclaims that all private property has been returned to the owners, whichever is earlier.  The decision of the appraisers shall be final and binding upon both the governor and the claimant, provided that either party may file a petition in the circuit court within sixty days after the rendering of a decision of the board, praying for the decision of the court upon the claim.  The petition, if filed by the government, shall be entitled in the name of the State, by the attorney general, and shall be heard and decided by the circuit court without the intervention of a jury.  If filed by any other party, the petition shall be filed, heard, and decided in the manner provided for suits against the State.  A further review by the supreme court may be had as provided by law in such cases.  The court may order the joinder of other parties, or may allow other parties to intervene.  Any award which has become final shall be paid out of any funds available under this chapter, and if not sufficient, out of the general revenues of the State not otherwise appropriated.
