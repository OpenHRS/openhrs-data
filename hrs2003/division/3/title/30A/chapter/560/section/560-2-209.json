    "text": "(a)  In a proceeding for an elective share, the following are applied first to satisfy the elective-share amount and to reduce or eliminate any contributions due from the decedent's probate estate and recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tAmounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-204 which pass or have passed to the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary by testate or intestate succession and amounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-206; and\n\t(2)\tAmounts included in the augmented estate under section 560:2-207 up to the applicable percentage thereof.  For the purposes of this subsection, the \"applicable percentage\" is twice the elective-share percentage set forth in the schedule in section 560:2-202(a) appropriate to the length of time:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe spouse and the decedent were married to each other; or\n\t\t(B)\tThe reciprocal beneficiary and the decedent were in a reciprocal beneficiary relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(b)  If, after the application of subsection (a), the elective-share amount is not fully satisfied or the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is entitled to a supplemental elective-share amount, amounts included in the decedent's probate estate and in the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others, other than amounts included under section 560:2-205(3)(A) or (C), are applied first to satisfy the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share amount or the supplemental elective-share amount.  The decedent's probate estate and that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others are so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share amount or for the supplemental elective-share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the decedent's probate estate and of that portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein.\n\t(c)  If, after the application of subsections (a) and (b), the elective-share or supplemental elective-share amount is not fully satisfied, the remaining portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others is so applied that liability for the unsatisfied balance of the elective-share or supplemental elective-share amount is equitably apportioned among the recipients of the remaining portion of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others in proportion to the value of their interests therein.
