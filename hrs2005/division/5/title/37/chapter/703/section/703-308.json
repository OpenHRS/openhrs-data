[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; gen ch 1993]\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  The purpose of this section is to provide a justification for the use of force to prevent suicide, serious bodily injury, or the commission of a crime.  It gives a right to use such force as the actor believes is immediately necessary to prevent suicide or serious bodily injury, or to prevent a crime involving or threatening bodily harm, damage to or loss of property, or a breach of the peace.  The right to use force in crime prevention is a concomitant of the right to use force to make an arrest spelled out in \u00a7703-307.  It is, however, limited by all of the limitations expressed in the preceding sections.  Deadly force may not be used except for the purpose of preventing a crime which will cause death or serious bodily injury, under circumstances in which there is no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons.  Deadly force may also be used if the actor believes such force is necessary to suppress a riot, following an appropriate warning.\n  Subsection (2) contains a rule about the use of confinement as preventive force, similar to the rules on the same subject in \u00a7\u00a7703-304 to 306.\n  Previous Hawaii case law did not distinguish the defense presented in this section from that in \u00a7703-307, on the use of force in law enforcement.[1]  The Code provides clarification on the issue.\n__________\n Commentary:\n1.
