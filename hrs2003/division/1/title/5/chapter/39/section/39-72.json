    "text": "When there are moneys in the general, special, or revolving funds of the State, which in the judgment of the director of finance are in excess of the amounts necessary for the immediate state requirements, the director of finance may make temporary transfers of moneys to the department for purposes for which revenue bonds may be issued, if in the judgment of the director of finance the action will not impede or hamper the necessary financial operations of the State.  The total amount of temporary transfers for any undertaking or loan program shall not exceed the sum of the unissued revenue bonds authorized therefor by the legislature.  The general, special, or revolving funds shall be reimbursed from the proceeds upon the eventual issuance and sale of the revenue bonds.  The sale of the revenue bonds shall not be deferred beyond the date fixed by the director of finance for reimbursement. \tThe director of finance may make temporary transfers from the general, special, or revolving funds to any account which has been set up in the treasury for the payment of revenue bonds, or the interest thereon, or to any other account which has been set up in the treasury for the making of other payments as are provided or required in this part.  Any transfer may be made when the account is first opened and prior to any payment therefrom, or prior to the issuance of revenue bonds for the undertaking or loan program, or at any time when the account may be temporarily depleted.  No transfer shall be made unless, in the judgment of the director of finance, the account to which the moneys are transferred will be able to effect reimbursement on or before the date fixed by the director of finance for reimbursement.\n\tNo interest shall be charged upon any transfer made, and transfers shall be made only upon the request of the department.
