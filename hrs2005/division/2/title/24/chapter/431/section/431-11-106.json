If the commissioner determines that the separate transactions were entered into over any twelve-month period for that purpose, the commissioner may exercise the commissioner's authority under section 431:11-111.\n\t(4)\tThe commissioner, in reviewing transactions pursuant to subsection (a)(2), shall consider whether the transactions comply with the standards set forth in subsection (a)(1) and whether they may adversely affect the interests of policyholders.\n\t(5)\tThe commissioner shall be notified within thirty days of any investment of the domestic insurer in any one corporation if the total investment in the corporation by the insurance holding company system exceeds ten per cent of the corporation's voting securities.\n\t(b)\t(1)\tNo domestic insurer shall pay any extraordinary dividend or make any other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders until:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThirty days after the commissioner has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within the period disapproved the payment; or\n\t\t(B)\tThe commissioner has approved the payment within the thirty-day period.\n\n\t(2)\tFor purposes of this section, an extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of:\n\n\t\t(A)\tTen per cent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or\n\t\t(B)\tThe net gain from operations of a life insurer, or the net income, if the insurer is not a life insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding.\n\n\t\tExtraordinary dividend or distribution shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities.\n\t\t\tIn determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer other than a life insurer may carry forward income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends.  This carry-forward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years.\n\t\t\tNotwithstanding any other provisions of law, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution that is conditional upon the commissioner's approval thereof, and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until the commissioner has either approved the payment of the dividend or distribution or has not disapproved the payment within the thirty-day period referred to above.\n\t(c)\t(1)\tNotwithstanding the control of a domestic insurer by any person, the officers and directors of the insurer shall not thereby be relieved of any obligation or liability which they would otherwise be subject to by law.  The insurer shall be managed so as to assure its separate operating identity consistent with this article.\n\t(2)\tNothing herein shall preclude a domestic insurer from having or sharing a common management or cooperative or joint use of personnel, property, or services with one or more other persons under arrangements meeting the standards of subsection (a)(1).\n\n\n\n\t(d)  For purposes of this article, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors, among others, shall be considered:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe size of the insurer as measured by its assets, capital and surplus, reserves, premium writings, insurance in force, and other appropriate criteria;\n\t(2)\tThe extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance;\n\t(3)\tThe number and size of risks insured in each line of business;\n\t(4)\tThe extent of the geographical dispersion of the insurer's insured risks;\n\t(5)\tThe nature and extent of the insurer's reinsurance program;\n\t(6)\tThe quality, diversification, and liquidity of the insurer's investment portfolio;\n\t(7)\tThe recent past and projected future trend in the size of the insurer's investment portfolio;\n\t(8)\tThe surplus as regards policyholders maintained by other comparable insurers;\n\t(9)\tThe adequacy of the insurer's reserves; and\n\t(10)\tThe quality and liquidity of investments in affiliates.  The commissioner may treat any investment as a disallowed asset for purposes of determining the adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders whenever in the commissioner's judgment the investment so warrants.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  In determining the adequacy and reasonableness of an\ninsurer's surplus, no single factor is necessarily controlling,\nand the commissioner shall:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tConsider the net effect of all of the factors, along with other factors bearing on the financial condition of the insurer;\n\t(2)\tIn comparing the surplus maintained by other insurers, consider the extent to which each of these factors varies among insurers; and\n\t(3)\tIn determining the quality and liquidity of investments in subsidiaries, consider the individual subsidiary and discount or disallow its valuation to the extent warranted by individual investments.
