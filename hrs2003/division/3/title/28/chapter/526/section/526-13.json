    "text": "(a)  A disclaimer is barred by a written waiver of the right to disclaim.\n\t(b)  A disclaimer of an interest in property is barred if any of the following events occur before the disclaimer becomes effective:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe disclaimant accepts the interest sought to be disclaimed;\n\t(2)\tThe disclaimant voluntarily assigns, conveys, encumbers, pledges, or transfers the interest sought to be disclaimed or contracts to do so; or\n\t(3)\tA judicial sale of the interest sought to be disclaimed occurs.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise.\n\t(d)  A disclaimer, in whole or part, of the future exercise of a power not held in a fiduciary capacity is not barred by its previous exercise unless the power is exercisable in favor of the disclaimant.\n\t(e)  A disclaimer is barred or limited if so provided by law other than this chapter.\n\t(f)  A disclaimer of a power over property which is barred by this section is ineffective.  A disclaimer of an interest in property which is barred by this section takes effect as a transfer of the interest disclaimed to the persons who would have taken the interest under this chapter had the disclaimer not been barred.
