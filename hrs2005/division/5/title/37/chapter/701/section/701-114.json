[L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71; am L 1973, c 136, \u00a72(a)]\nCross References\n  Elements of an offense, see \u00a7702-205.\nCOMMENTARY ON \n  This section announces the usual burden of proof in criminal cases; the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The matters which must be so proved are spelled out in detail.  They include elements of the offense, the requisite state of mind, and facts establishing jurisdiction, venue, and timeliness.\nSUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTARY ON \n  Section 114(2) of the Proposed Draft of the Code had provided that the \"innocence of the defendant is assumed.\"  The Legislature found that \"the use of the word 'assumed' in this manner is novel and prefers the term 'presumed' since it has a definite meaning in jurisprudence.\"  Conference Committee Report No. 2 (1972).\n  Act 136, Session Laws 1973, amended this section by adding the introductory phrase now contained in subsection (1) (\"Except as otherwise provided in section 701-115, ...\") to eliminate the possibility of confusion in the application of \u00a7 and 701-115.\nCase Notes\n  Appearance in court by defendant did not waive right to insist that State prove venue.  66 H. 530, 668 P.2d 32.\n  State need not establish jurisdiction of trial court by proving defendant is over 18 years of age.  67 H. 68, 678 P.2d. 1080.\n  Proof beyond a reasonable doubt not established where trial judge found defendant guilty based on substantial credible evidence.  72 H. 296, 815 P.2d 1025.\n  Requirements of HRPP rule 18 and article I, \u00a714 of Hawai`i constitution having been satisfied, venue was proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  78 H. 185, 891 P.2d 272.\n  State tax maps could not be used to establish venue in DUI prosecution where maps did not represent legislatively authorized schematics of official district boundaries for non-taxation purposes.  80 H. 291, 909 P.2d 1106.\n  Officer's testimony regarding Ewa boundary of Honolulu district, being probative of \"facts establishing venue\" under this section, was relevant and admissible under chapter 626, rule 803(b)(20).  80 H. 297, 909 P.2d 1112.\n  Testimony of officer supplemented with tax map information which court could have taken judicial notice of pursuant to chapter 626, rule 201, constituted substantial evidence supporting \"facts establishing venue\" with respect to DUI offense.  80 H. 297, 909 P.2d 1112.\n  Where defendant requested court to instruct jury on time-barred lesser included offense of simple trespass under \u00a7708-815, defendant waived statute of limitations under subsection (1)(e).  87 H. 108, 952 P.2d 865.\n  Failure to instruct jury as to venue and timeliness of prosecution is error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  5 H. App. 644, 706 P.2d 1321.\n  State proved jurisdictional facts beyond a reasonable doubt.  8 H. App. 497, 810 P.2d 668.\n  Failure to instruct jury on state of mind element under \u00a7134-7, as required by subsection (1)(b), was prejudicial and not harmless error.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173.\n  Judicial notice taken that trial, being held in first circuit, was held in proper circuit.  78 H. 422 (App.), 895 P.2d 173."
