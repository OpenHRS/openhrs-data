    "text": "The procedures and remedies provided for in this part, and the rules adopted by the policy board, shall be the exclusive means available for persons aggrieved in connection with the award of a contract to resolve their concerns. [L 1997, c 190, pt of \u00a72]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Although \u00a7632-1 generally endorses declaratory relief in civil cases, it disallows such relief where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case; where this chapter provided for a protest process under \u00a7103F-501 through this section, and this section limited the protestor to an administrative process as the \"exclusive means\" to resolve contract disputes, declaratory relief under \u00a7632-1 was unavailable because \u00a7632-1 specifically mandates that the statutory remedy provided in this chapter must be followed.\u00a0 125 H. 200 (App.), 257 P.3d 213."
