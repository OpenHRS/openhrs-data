    "number": "8",
    "text": "All money or property found at the stadium shall be reported or delivered by the finder to the stadium lost and found, and when so delivered shall be held by the stadium for forty-five days or until claimed by some person who establishes title or right of custody thereto to the satisfaction of the stadium manager, whichever is shorter.  In the event of establishment of title or right of custody, the money or property shall be delivered to the claimant by the manager or the manager's agent.  If after forty-five days no claimant establishes a right to the money or property, the money or property may be claimed by the person who delivered it to the stadium lost and found; provided that if the person who delivered it to the stadium lost and found fails to claim the money or property within thirty days after being notified by the manager, the manager shall deposit the money into the state treasury to the credit of the stadium special fund or shall dispose of the property by public auction.  The manager shall give public notice, giving details as to time and place of the auction and giving notice to all persons interested in claiming the property that unless claims are made by persons who can provide satisfactory proof of ownership before a specified date, the property will be sold at public auction to the highest bidder; provided that if the manager considers the highest bid to be insufficient, the manager shall have the right to decline the sale to the highest bidder and may reoffer the property at a subsequent public auction.  On the day and at the place specified in the notice, all property for which no satisfactory proof of ownership is made shall be sold by auction by or under the direction of the manager. \tIf any property which is of a perishable nature or which is unreasonably expensive to keep or safeguard remains unclaimed at the stadium, the manager may sell that property at public auction, at a time and after notice that is reasonable under the circumstances.  If the manager determines that any property delivered to the manager pursuant to this section has no apparent commercial value, the manager at any time thereafter may destroy or otherwise dispose of the property.\n\tThe manager shall deposit into the stadium special fund all moneys received from the sale, destruction, or disposition of any property.  No action or proceeding shall be brought or maintained against the State or any officer thereof on account of such sale, destruction, or disposition.  The purchaser of property at any sale conducted by the manager pursuant to this section shall receive good title to the property purchased and shall take possession of the property free from any and all claims of the owner, prior owners, and any person claiming title.\n\tFor purposes of this section, notice by regular mail to the last known address of the person who delivered the money or property to the stadium lost and found shall be deemed sufficient.
