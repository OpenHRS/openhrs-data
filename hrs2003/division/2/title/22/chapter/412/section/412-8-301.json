The term \"investment grade\" means notes, bonds, certificates of interest or participation, beneficial interests, mortgage or receivable-related securities, and other obligations that are commonly understood to be of investment grade quality, including without limitation those securities that are rated within the four highest grades by any nationally-recognized rating service or unrated securities of similar quality as reasonably determined by the trust company in its prudent judgment (which may be based in part upon estimates which it believes to be reliable).  Investment grade does not include investments which are predominantly speculative in nature.  The aggregate amount invested by a trust company under this subsection and subsection (d) in any one company or other issuer shall not exceed twenty per cent of the trust company's capital and surplus.\n\t(f)  To the extent specified herein, a trust company may purchase, hold, convey, sell or lease real or personal property as follows:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe real property in or on which the business of the trust company is carried on, including its corporate offices, other space in the same property to rent as a source of income; permanent or vacation residences or recreational facilities for its officers and employees; other real property necessary to the accommodation of the trust company's business, including but not limited to parking facilities, data processing centers, and real property held for future corporate use where the trust company in good faith expects to utilize the property as trust company premises; provided, if the trust company ceases to use any real property and improvements thereon for one of the foregoing purposes, it shall, within five years thereafter, sell the real property or cease to carry it or them as an asset; provided further, such property shall not without the approval of the commissioner exceed seventy-five per cent of the trust company's capital and surplus;\n\t(2)\tPersonal property used in or necessary to the accommodation of the trust company's business, including but not limited to furniture, fixtures, equipment, vaults and safety deposit boxes.  The trust company's investment in furniture and fixtures shall not without the approval of the commissioner exceed twenty-five per cent of the trust company's capital and surplus.\n\n\n\n\tAny trust company acquiring any real property in any manner other than provided in this section shall immediately, upon receiving notice from the commissioner, charge the same to profit and loss, or otherwise remove the same from assets, and when any loss impairs the capital and surplus of the trust company the impairment shall be made good in the manner provided in this chapter.
