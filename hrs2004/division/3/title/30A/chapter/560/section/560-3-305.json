    "text": "If the registrar is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 560:3-303 and 560:3-304 or any other reason, the registrar may decline the application.  A declination of informal probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings. [L 1996, c 288, pt of \u00a71]"
