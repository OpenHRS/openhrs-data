    "text": "The legislature finds that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tInadequate treatment of severe acute pain and severe chronic pain originating from cancer or noncancerous conditions is a significant health problem;\n\t(2)\tFor some patients, pain management is the single most important treatment a physician can provide;\n\t(3)\tA patient who suffers from severe acute pain or severe chronic pain should have access to proper treatment of pain;\n\t(4)\tDue to the complexity of their problems, many patients who suffer from severe acute pain or severe chronic pain may require referral to a physician with expertise in the treatment of severe acute pain and severe chronic pain.  In some cases, severe acute pain and severe chronic pain is best treated by a team of clinicians to address the associated physical, psychological, social, and vocational issues;\n\t(5)\tIn the hands of knowledgeable, ethical, and experienced pain management practitioners, opiates administered for severe acute pain or severe chronic pain can be safe; and\n\t(6)\tOpiates may be part of an overall treatment plan for a patient in severe acute pain or severe chronic pain who has not obtained relief from any other means of treatment.
