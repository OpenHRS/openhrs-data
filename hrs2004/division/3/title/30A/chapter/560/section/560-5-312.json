    "text": "(a)  If the court finds that compliance with the procedures of this part will likely result in substantial harm to the respondent's health, safety, or welfare, and that no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances, the court, on petition by a person interested in the respondent's welfare, may appoint an emergency guardian whose authority may not exceed ninety days and who may exercise only the powers specified in the order.  Immediately upon appointment of an emergency guardian, the court may appoint a lawyer to represent the respondent throughout the emergency guardianship.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), reasonable notice of the time and place of a hearing on the petition shall be given to the respondent and any other persons as the court directs.\n\t(b)  An emergency guardian may be appointed without notice to the respondent and the respondent's lawyer only if the court finds from affidavit or testimony that the respondent will be substantially harmed before a hearing on the appointment can be held.  If the court appoints an emergency guardian without notice to the respondent, the respondent shall be given notice of the appointment within forty-eight hours after the appointment.  The court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment within ten days after the appointment unless extended by order of the court.\n\t(c)  Appointment of an emergency guardian, with or without notice, shall not be deemed a determination of the respondent's incapacity.\n\t(d)  The court may remove an emergency guardian or modify the powers granted at any time.  An emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires.  In other respects, the provisions of this article concerning guardians apply to an emergency guardian. [L 2004, c 161, pt of \u00a71]"
