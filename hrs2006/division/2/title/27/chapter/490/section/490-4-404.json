[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-404; HRS \u00a7490:4-404; ree L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0\u00a0Purposes:\n\u00a0 This section incorporates a type of statute adopted in twenty-six jurisdictions.\u00a0 The time limit is set at six months because banking and commercial practice regards a check outstanding for longer than that period as stale, and a bank will normally not pay such a check without consulting the depositor.\u00a0 It is therefore not required to do so, but is given the option to pay because it may be in a position to know, as in the case of dividend checks, that the drawer wants payment made.\n\u00a0 Certified checks are excluded from the section because they are the primary obligation of the certifying bank (Sections 3-411 and 3-413), which obligation runs direct to the holder of the check.\u00a0 The customer's account was charged when the check was certified.\n\u00a0\u00a0Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-411 and 3-413.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Account\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Bank\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Check\".\u00a0 Section 3-104.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Present\".\u00a0 Section 3-504."
