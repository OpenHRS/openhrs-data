    "text": "(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d), the interest of a protected person in property vested in a conservator is not transferable or assignable by the protected person.  An attempted transfer or assignment by the protected person, although ineffective to affect property rights, may give rise to a claim against the protected person for restitution or damages which, subject to presentation and allowance, may be satisfied as provided in section 560:5-429.\n\t(b)  Property vested in a conservator by appointment and the interest of the protected person in that property are not subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against the protected person unless allowed under section 560:5-429.\n\t(c)  A person without knowledge of the conservatorship who in good faith and for security or substantially equivalent value receives delivery from a protected person of tangible personal property of a type normally transferred by delivery of possession, is protected as if the protected person or transferee had valid title.\n\t(d)  A third party who deals with the protected person with respect to property vested in a conservator is entitled to any protection provided in other law.
