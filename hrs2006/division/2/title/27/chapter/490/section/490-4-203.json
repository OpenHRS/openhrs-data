[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-203; HRS ; am L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None; but see Section 2 of the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 This Section adopts a \"chain of command\" theory which renders it unnecessary for an intermediary or collecting bank to determine whether its transferor is \"authorized\" to give the instructions.\u00a0 Equally the bank is not put on notice of any \"revocation of authority\" or \"lack of authority\" by notice received from any other person.\u00a0 The desirability of speed in the collection process and the fact that, by reason of advances made, the transferor may have the paramount interest in the item requires the rule.\n\u00a0 The Section is made subject to the provisions of Article 3 concerning conversion of instruments (Section 3-419) and other provisions of Article 3 and this Article concerning restrictive indorsements (Sections 3-205, 3-206, 3-419, 3-603, 4-205).\u00a0 Of course instructions from or an agreement with its transferor does not relieve a collecting bank of its general obligation to exercise good faith and ordinary care.\u00a0 See Section 4-103(1).\u00a0 If in any particular case a bank has exercised good faith and ordinary care and is relieved of responsibility by reason of instructions of or an agreement with its transferor, the owner of the item may still have a remedy for loss against the transferor (another bank) if such transferor has given wrongful instructions.\n\u00a0 The rules of the Section are applied only to collecting banks.\u00a0 Payor banks always have the problem of making proper payment of an item; whether such payment is proper should be based upon all of the rules of Articles 3 and 4 and all of the facts of any particular case, and should not be dependent exclusively upon instructions from or an agreement with a person presenting the item.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-205, 3-206, 3-419, 3-603, 4-103(1) and 4-205.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Restrictive indorsement\".\u00a0 Section 3-205."
