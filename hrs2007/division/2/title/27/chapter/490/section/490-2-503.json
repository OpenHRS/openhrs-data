[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-503; HRS ; am L 2004, c 163, \u00a79]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 See Sections 11, 19, 20, 43 (3) and (4), 46 and 51, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 The general policy of the above sections is continued and supplemented but subsection (3) changes the rule of prior section 19(5) as what constitutes a \"destination\" contract and subsection (4) incorporates a minor correction as to tender of delivery of goods in the possession of a bailee.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The major general rules governing the manner of proper or due tender of delivery are gathered in this section.\u00a0 The term \"tender\" is used in this Article in two different senses.\u00a0 In one sense it refers to \"due tender\" which contemplates an offer coupled with a present ability to fulfill all the conditions resting on the tendering party and must be followed by actual performance if the other party shows himself ready to proceed.\u00a0 Unless the context unmistakably indicates otherwise this is the meaning of \"tender\" in this Article and the occasional addition of the word \"due\" is only for clarity and emphasis.\u00a0 At other times it is used to refer to an offer of goods or documents under a contract as if in fulfillment of its conditions even though there is a defect when measured against the contract obligation.\u00a0 Used in either sense, however, \"tender\" connotes such performance by the tendering party as puts the other party in default if he fails to proceed in some manner.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The seller's general duty to tender and deliver is laid down in Section 2-301 and more particularly in Section 2-507.\u00a0 The seller's right to a receipt if he demands one and receipts are customary is governed by Section 1-205.\u00a0 Subsection (1) of the present section proceeds to set forth two primary requirements of tender: first, that the seller \"put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition\" and, second, that he \"give the buyer any notice reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.\"\n\u00a0 In cases in which payment is due and demanded upon delivery the \"buyer's disposition\" is qualified by the seller's right to retain control of the goods until payment by the provision of this Article on delivery on condition.\u00a0 However, where the seller is demanding payment on delivery he must first allow the buyer to inspect the goods in order to avoid impairing his tender unless the contract for sale is on C.I.F., C.O.D., cash against documents or similar terms negating the privilege of inspection before payment.\n\u00a0 In the case of contracts involving documents the seller can \"put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition\" under subsection (1) by tendering documents which give the buyer complete control of the goods under the provisions of Article 7 on due negotiation.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Under paragraph (a) of subsection (1) usage of the trade and the circumstances of the particular case determine what is a reasonable hour for tender and what constitutes a reasonable period of holding the goods available.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 The buyer must furnish reasonable facilities for the receipt of the goods tendered by the seller under subsection (1), paragraph (b).\u00a0 This obligation of the buyer is no part of the seller's tender.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) there is omitted from this Article the rule under prior uniform legislation that a term requiring the seller to pay the freight or cost of transportation to the buyer is equivalent to an agreement by the seller to deliver to the buyer or at an agreed destination.\u00a0 This omission is with the specific intention of negating the rule, for under this Article the \"shipment\" contract is regarded as the normal one and the \"destination\" contract as the variant type.\u00a0 The seller is not obligated to deliver at a named destination and bear the concurrent risk of loss until arrival, unless he has specifically agreed so to deliver or the commercial understanding of the terms used by the parties contemplates such delivery.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 Paragraph (a) of subsection (4) continues the rule of the prior uniform legislation as to acknowledgment by the bailee.\u00a0 Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) adopts the rule that between the buyer and the seller the risk of loss remains on the seller during a period reasonable for securing acknowledgment of the transfer from the bailee, while as against all other parties the buyer's rights are fixed as of the time the bailee receives notice of the transfer.\n\u00a0 7.\u00a0 Under subsection (5) documents are never \"required\" except where there is an express contract term or it is plainly implicit in the peculiar circumstances of the case or in a usage of trade.\u00a0 Documents may, of course, be \"authorized\" although not required, but such cases are not within the scope of this subsection.\u00a0 When documents are required, there are three main requirements of this subsection:\u00a0 (1) \"All\":\u00a0 each required document is essential to a proper tender; (2) \"Such\":\u00a0 the documents must be the ones actually required by the contract in terms of source and substance; (3) \"Correct form\":\u00a0 All documents must be in correct form.\n\u00a0 When a prescribed document cannot be procured, a question of fact arises under the provision of this Article on substituted performance as to whether the agreed manner of delivery is actually commercially impracticable and whether the substitute is commercially reasonable.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 1-205, 2-301, 2-310,
