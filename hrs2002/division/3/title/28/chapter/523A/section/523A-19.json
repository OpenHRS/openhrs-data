    "text": "(a)  Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), a person who is required to file a report under section 523A-17, within six months after the final date for filing the report as required by section 523A-17, shall pay or deliver to the director all abandoned property required to be reported. \n\t(b)  If the owner establishes the right to receive the abandoned property to the satisfaction of the holder before the property has been delivered or it appears that for some other reason the presumption of abandonment is erroneous, the holder need not pay or deliver the property to the director, and the property will no longer be presumed abandoned.  In that case, the holder shall file with the director a verified written explanation of the proof of claim or of the error in the presumption of abandonment. \n\t(c)  Property reported under section 523A-17 for which the holder is not required to report the name of the apparent owner shall be delivered to the director at the time of filing the report. \n\t(d)  The holder of an interest under section 523A-10 shall deliver a duplicate certificate or other evidence of ownership if the holder does not issue certificates of ownership to the director.  Upon delivery of a duplicate certificate to the director, the holder and any transfer agent, registrar, or other person acting for or on behalf of a holder in executing or delivering the duplicate certificate is relieved of all liability of every kind in accordance with section 523A-20 to every person, including any person acquiring the original certificate or the duplicate of the certificate issued to the director, for any losses or damages resulting to any person by the issuance and delivery to the director of the duplicate certificate.
