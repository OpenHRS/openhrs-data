    "text": "All special facility revenue bonds, including special facility revenue refunding bonds, authorized to be issued shall be issued pursuant to part III of chapter 39, except as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (1)\u00a0 No such revenue bonds shall be issued unless at the time of issuance the department shall have entered into a special facility lease with respect to the special facility for which such revenue bonds are to be issued.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2)\u00a0 Such revenue bonds shall be issued in the name of the department, and not in the name of the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (3)\u00a0 No further authorization of the legislature shall be required for the issuance of the special facility revenue bonds, but the approval of the governor shall be required for such issuance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (4)\u00a0 Such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the revenues derived by the department from the special facility for which they are issued, as defined in section 266-51(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (5)\u00a0 The final maturity date of such revenue bonds shall not be later than either the estimated life of the special facility for which they are issued or the initial term of the special facility lease.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (6)\u00a0 If deemed necessary or advisable by the department, or to permit the obligations of the other person to the special facility lease to be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, the department with the approval of the state director of finance may appoint a national or state bank within or without the State to serve as trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds and may enter into a trust indenture or trust agreement with such trustee.\u00a0 The trustee may be authorized by the department to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which the revenue bonds are issued and to apply such revenues to the payment of the principal and interest on such revenue bonds.\u00a0 In the event that any such trustee shall be appointed, any trust indenture or agreement entered into by the department with the trustee may contain the covenants and provisions authorized by part III of chapter 39 to be inserted in a resolution adopted or certificate issued, as though the words \"resolution\" or \"certificate\" as used in that part read \"trust indenture or agreement\".\u00a0 Such covenants and provisions shall not be required to be included in the resolution or certificate authorizing the issuance of the revenue bonds if included in the trust indenture or agreement.\u00a0 Any resolution or certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement adopted, issued, or entered into by the department pursuant to this part may also contain any provisions required for the qualification thereof under the United States Trust Indenture Act of 1939.\u00a0 The department may pledge and assign to the trustee the special facility lease and the rights of the department including the revenues thereunder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (7)\u00a0 If the department with the approval of the state director of finance shall have appointed or shall appoint a trustee for the holders of the revenue bonds, then notwithstanding the second sentence of section 39-68 the director of finance may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the payment of the principal and interest, and for the purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, of the revenue bonds, or may elect to limit the functions the director shall perform as such fiscal agent.\u00a0 The department with the approval of the director of finance may appoint the trustee to serve as such fiscal agent, and may authorize and empower the trustee to perform such functions with respect to such payment, purchase, registration, transfer, exchange, and redemption, as the department may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient, including, without limitation, the holding of the revenue bonds and coupons which have been paid, and the supervision and destruction thereof in accordance with sections 40-10 and 40-11.\u00a0 Nothing in this paragraph shall be a limitation upon or be construed as a limitation upon the powers granted in the preceding paragraph to the department with the approval of the director of finance to appoint the trustee, or granted in sections 36-3 and 39-13 and the third sentence of section 39-68 to the director of finance to appoint the trustee or others, as fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars for the revenue bonds or to authorize and empower such fiscal agents, paying agents, and registrars to perform the functions referred to in such paragraph and sections, it being the intent of this paragraph to confirm that the director of finance as aforesaid may elect not to serve as fiscal agent for the revenue bonds or may elect to limit the functions the director shall perform as such fiscal agent, as the director of finance may deem necessary, advisable, or expedient.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (8)\u00a0 The department may sell such revenue bonds either at public or private sale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (9)\u00a0 If no trustee shall be appointed to collect, hold, and administer the revenues derived from the special facility for which such revenue bonds are issued, such revenues shall be held in a separate account in the treasury of the State, separate and apart from the harbor special fund, to be applied solely to the carrying out of the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement authorizing or securing such revenue bonds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (10)\u00a0 If the resolution, certificate, trust indenture, or trust agreement shall provide that no revenue bonds issued thereunder shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless certified or authenticated by the trustee for the holders of such revenue bonds, signatures of the officers of the State upon such bonds and the coupons thereof as required by section 39-56 may be evidenced by their facsimile signatures.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (11)\u00a0 The proceeds of such revenue bonds may be used and applied by the department to reimburse the other person to the special facility lease for all preliminary costs and expenses, including architectural and legal costs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (12)\u00a0 If the special facility lease shall require the other person to operate, maintain, and repair the special facility which is the subject of such lease, at the other person's expense, such requirement shall constitute compliance by the department with section 39-61(a)(2), and none of the revenues derived by the department from such special facility shall be required to be applied to the purposes of section 39-62(2).\u00a0 Sections 39-62(4), 39-62(5), and 39-62(6) shall not be applicable to the revenues derived from a special facility lease.
