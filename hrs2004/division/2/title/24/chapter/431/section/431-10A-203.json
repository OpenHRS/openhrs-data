    "text": "\u00a7431:10A-203    Every policy of group or blanket disability insurance shall contain in substance the following provisions, or provisions which in the opinion of the commissioner are more favorable to the individuals insured, or at least as favorable to such individuals and more favorable to the policyholder.  No such policy of group or blanket disability insurance shall contain any provision relative to notice or proof of loss, or to the time for paying benefits, or to the time within which suit may be brought upon the policy, which in the opinion of the commissioner is less favorable to the individuals insured than would be permitted by the standard provisions required for individual accident and health or sickness insurance policies.\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tRepresentations.  There shall be a provision that:\n\n\t\t(A)\tAll statements, made by the policyholder or by the individuals insured, shall be deemed to be representations and not warranties;\n\t\t(B)\tNo statement, made in the application by the policyholder, shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the application, if any, of the policyholder shall be attached to the policy when issued;\n\t\t(C)\tNo statement made by any individual insured shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the instrument containing the statement is or has been furnished to such individual or to the individual's beneficiary, if any; and\n\t\t(D)\tA misrepresentation, unless it is made with actual intent to deceive or unless it materially affects either the acceptance of the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer, shall not prevent a recovery on the policy.\n\n\t(2)\tCertificates.  There shall be a provision that the insurer shall issue to the policyholder for delivery to each insured employee or member, an individual certificate setting forth in summary form a statement of the essential features of the insurance coverage, and to whom the benefits are payable.  If family members are insured, only one certificate need be issued for each family.  This paragraph shall not apply to blanket disability insurance policies.\n\t(3)\tAdditional insureds.  There shall be a provision that to the group originally insured may be added, from time to time, eligible new employees, members, or dependents, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the policy.\n\t(4)\tAge limitations.  There shall be a provision specifying:\n\n\t\t(A)\tThe ages, if any, to which the insurance provided shall be limited;\n\t\t(B)\tThe ages, if any, for which additional restrictions are placed on benefits; and\n\t\t(C)\tThe additional restrictions placed on the benefits at such ages.\n\n\t(5)\tPayment of premiums.  There shall be a provision that all premiums due under the policy shall be remitted by the employer or employers of the persons insured, by the policyholder or by some other designated person acting on behalf of the association or group insured, to the insurer on or before the due date thereof within such grace period as may be specified therein.
