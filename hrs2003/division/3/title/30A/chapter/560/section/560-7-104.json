    "name": "Effect of failure to register",
    "number": "7-104",
    "text": "A trustee who fails to register a trust in a proper court as required by this Part, for purposes of any proceedings initiated by a beneficiary of the trust prior to registration, is subject to the personal jurisdiction of any court in which the trust could have been registered.  In addition, any trustee who, within thirty days after receipt of a written demand by a settlor or beneficiary of the trust, fails to register a trust as required by this Part is subject to removal and denial of compensation or to surcharge as the court may direct.  Except as provided in section 560:1-108, a provision in the terms of the trust purporting to excuse the trustee from the duty to register, or directing that the trust or trustee shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the court, is ineffective. [L 1976, c 200, pt of \u00a71]"
