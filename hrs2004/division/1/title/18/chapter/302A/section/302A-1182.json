The provisional approval shall be effective for one year.  The board may extend the provisional approval beyond a period of one year.  If a charter is subsequently issued, the amended implementation plan shall be converted to a written performance contract between the school and the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t(f)  An amended implementation plan shall be submitted within thirty working days of notification pursuant to subsection (e)(2)(A).  The board shall deny the issuance of a charter if the local school board does not submit an amended implementation plan within the thirty working day period.  The panel shall have thirty working days to review the amended implementation plan.  If the amended implementation plan:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tMeets the requirements of subsection (c) and section 302A-1184, the panel shall by the thirtieth working day submit a recommendation to the board of education to issue a charter to the proposed new century charter school.  If a charter is issued, the amended implementation plan shall be converted to a written performance contract between the school and the  board; or\n\t(2)\tFails to address the findings to the panel's satisfaction the panel shall deny issuance of a charter.\n\n\n\n\t(g)  A local school board may file an appeal of the denial of an application for a charter with the panel.
