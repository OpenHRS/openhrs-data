This cancellation shall be made after the department has determined that the continued use of the pesticide would result in unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.\n\t(c)  If the department determines that action is necessary to prevent an imminent hazard during the time required for cancellation proceedings, the department may suspend the license of a pesticide immediately.  The suspension order shall be in effect until the department issues its final order either cancelling or denying the cancellation of the license.\n\t(d)  The licensee shall be entitled to contest under chapter 91, the determinations of the department relative to refusing, cancelling, or suspending a pesticide license.
