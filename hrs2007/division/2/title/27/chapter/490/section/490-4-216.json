[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-214; HRS \u00a7490:4-214; am and ren L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None; but see Section 13.\u00a0 American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 The underlying purpose of the provisions of this section is not to confer upon banks, holders of items or anyone else preferential positions in the event of bank failures over general depositors or any other creditors of the failed banks.\u00a0 The purpose is to fix as definitely as possible the cut-off point of time for the completion or cessation of the collection process in the case of items that happen to be in such process at the time a particular bank suspends payments.\u00a0 It must be remembered that in bank collections as a whole and in the handling of items by an individual bank, items go through a whole series of processes.\u00a0 It must also be remembered that at any particular point of time a particular bank (at least one of any size) is functioning as a depositary bank for some items, as an intermediary bank for others, as a presenting bank for still others and as a payor bank for still others, and that when it suspends payments it will have close to its normal load of items working through its various processes.\u00a0 For the convenience of receivers, owners of items, banks, and in fact substantially everyone concerned, it is recognized that at the particular moment of time that a bank suspends payment, a certain portion of the items being handled by it have progressed far enough in the bank collection process that it is preferable to permit them to continue the remaining distance, rather than to send them back and reverse the many entries that have been made or the steps that have been taken with respect to them.\u00a0 Therefore, having this background and these purposes in mind, the section states what items must be turned backward at the moment suspension intervenes and what items have progressed far enough that the collection process with respect to them continues, with the resulting necessary statement of rights of various parties flowing from this prescription of the cut-off time.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The rules stated are similar to those stated in the American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code, but with the abandonment of any theory of trust.\u00a0 Although for practical purposes Federal Deposit Insurance affects materially the result of bank failures on holders of items and banks, no attempt is made to vary the rules of the section by reason of such insurance.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 It is recognized that in view of Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 294 U.S. 216, 55 S.Ct. 394, 79 L.Ed. 869, 99 A.L.R. 1248 (1935), amendment of the National Bank Act would be necessary to have this section apply to national banks.\u00a0 But there is no reason why it should not apply to others.\u00a0 See Section 1-108.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 1-108, 4-211(3) and 4-213.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Customer\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Presenting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Settlement\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Suspends payment\".\u00a0 Section 4-104."
