[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-105; HRS \u00a7490:2-105]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) - Sections 5, 6 and 76, Uniform Sales Act; Subsections (5) and (6) - none.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Rewritten.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes and New Matter:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) on \"goods\":\u00a0 The phraseology of the prior uniform statutory provision has been changed so that:\n\u00a0 The definition of goods is based on the concept of movability and the term \"chattels personal\" is not used.\u00a0 It is not intended to deal with things which are not fairly identifiable as movables before the contract is performed.\n\u00a0 Growing crops are included within the definition of goods since they are frequently intended for sale.\u00a0 The concept of \"industrial\" growing crops has been abandoned, for under modern practices fruit, perennial hay, nursery stock and the like must be brought within the scope of this Article.\u00a0 The young of animals are also included expressly in this definition since they, too, are frequently intended for sale and may be contracted for before birth.\u00a0 The period of gestation of domestic animals is such that the provisions of the section on identification can apply as in the case of crops to be planted.\u00a0 The reason of this definition also leads to the inclusion of a wool crop or the like as \"goods\" subject to identification under this Article.\n\u00a0 The exclusion of \"money in which the price is to be paid\" from the definition of goods does not mean that foreign currency which is included in the definition of money may not be the subject matter of a sales transaction.\u00a0 Goods is intended to cover the sale of money when money is being treated as a commodity but not to include it when money is the medium of payment.\n\u00a0 As to contracts to sell timber, minerals, or structures to be removed from the land Section 2-107(1) (Goods to be severed from Realty: recording) controls.\n\u00a0 The use of the word \"fixtures\" is avoided in view of the diversity of definitions of that term.\u00a0 This Article in including within its scope \"things attached to realty\" adds the further test that they must be capable of severance without material harm thereto.\u00a0 As between the parties any identified things which fall within that definition become \"goods\" upon the making of the contract for sale.\n\u00a0 \"Investment securities\" are expressly excluded from the coverage of this Article.\u00a0 It is not intended by this exclusion, however, to prevent the application of a particular section of this Article by analogy to securities (as was done with the Original Sales Act in Agar v. Orda, 264 N.Y. 248, 190 N.E. 479, 99 A.L.R. 269 (1934)) when the reason of that section makes such application sensible and the situation involved is not covered by the Article of this Act dealing specifically with such securities (Article 8).\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 References to the fact that a contract for sale can extend to future or contingent goods and that ownership in common follows the sale of a part interest have been omitted here as obvious without need for expression; hence no inference to negate these principles should be drawn from their omission.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (4) does not touch the question of how far an appropriation of a bulk of fungible goods may or may not satisfy the contract for sale.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Subsections (5) and (6) on \"lot\" and \"commercial unit\" are introduced to aid in the phrasing of later sections.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 The question of when an identification of goods takes place is determined by the provisions of Section 2-501 and all that this section says is what kinds of goods may be the subject of a sale.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Sections 2-107, 2-201, 2-501 and Article 8.\n\u00a0 Point 5:\u00a0 Section 2-501.\n\u00a0 See also Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Fungible\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Money\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Present sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Permanently affixed lanai tile not a \"good\" within the meaning of the Hawaii Uniform Commercial Code.\u00a0 841 F. Supp. 986."
