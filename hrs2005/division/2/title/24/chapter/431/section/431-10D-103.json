The maximum rate for each policy shall be determined at regular intervals at least once every twelve months, but not more frequently than once in any three-month period.  At the intervals specified in the policy, the rate being charged shall be reduced whenever such reduction as determined under subsection (b)(2) would decrease that rate by one-half per cent or more per annum.\n\t(e)  The life insurer shall:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tNotify the policyholder at the time a cash loan is made of the initial rate of interest on the loan;\n\t(2)\tNotify the policyholder with respect to premium loans of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so after making the initial loan.  Notice need not be given to the policyholder when a further premium loan is added, except as provided in paragraph (3); and\n\t(3)\tSend to policyholders with loans reasonable advance notice of any increase in the rate.\n\n\n\n\t(f)  No policy shall terminate in a policy year as the sole result of a change in the interest rate during that policy year, and the life insurer shall maintain coverage during that policy year until the time at which it would otherwise have terminated if there had been no change during that policy year.\n\t(g)  The substance of the pertinent provisions of subsections (a) through (d) shall be set forth in the policies to which they apply.
