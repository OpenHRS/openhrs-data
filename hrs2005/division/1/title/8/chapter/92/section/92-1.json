Rev. 21.\nAttorney General Opinions\n\n  Department of agriculture advisory committee on plants and animals subject to provisions of this part; subcommittees not subject to this part.  Att. Gen. Op. 90-7.\n     In a democracy, the people are vested with the ultimate decision-making power.  Governmental agencies exist to aid the people in the formation and conduct of public policy.  Opening up the governmental processes to public scrutiny and participation is the only viable and reasonable method of protecting the public's interest.  Therefore, the legislature declares that it is the policy of this State that the formation and conduct of public policy -the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of governmental agencies -shall be conducted as openly as possible.  To implement this policy the legislature declares that:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIt is the intent of this part to protect the people's right to know;\n\t(2)\tThe provisions requiring open meetings shall be liberally construed; and\n\t(3)\tThe provisions providing for exceptions to the open meeting requirements shall be strictly construed against closed meetings. [L 1975, c 166, pt of \u00a71]\n\n\n\n\nAttorney General Opinions\n\n  This section and sections 92-7 and 92-9 require commission to specify subject matter of items on public meeting agenda.  Att.
