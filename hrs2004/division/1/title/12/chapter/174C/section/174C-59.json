    "text": "A permit may be transferred, in whole or in part, from the permittee to another, if:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe conditions of use of the permit, including, but not limited to, place, quantity, and purpose of the use, remain the same; and\n\t(2)\tThe commission is informed of the transfer within ninety days.\n\n\n\n\tFailure to inform the commission of the transfer invalidates the transfer and constitutes a ground for revocation of the permit.  A transfer which involves a change in any condition of the permit, including a change in use covered in section 174C-57, is also invalid and constitutes a ground for revocation.
