    "text": "(1)  A person commits the offense of impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree if, with intent to deceive, the person pretends to be a law enforcement officer.\n\t(2)  Impersonating a law enforcement officer in the second degree is a misdemeanor. [L 1987, c 130, pt of \u00a73]\nCase Notes\n  Police officers did not violate a civil process server's Fourth Amendment rights, because the officers had probable cause to arrest the process server for impersonating a law enforcement officer; since no constitutional violation occurred, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.  348 F. Supp. 2d 1165."
