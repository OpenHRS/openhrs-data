Any proceeds from administrative penalties collected under this section shall be deposited into the public utilities commission special fund.\n\tThe commission, if consistent with the public interest, may suspend, restrict, or revoke the registration, charter, or certificate of the telecommunications carrier, thereby denying, modifying, or limiting the right of the telecommunications carrier to provide service in this State.\n\t(c)  The commission shall adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 91, necessary for the purposes of this section.  The commission may notify customers of their rights under these rules. [L 1998, c 225, \u00a71]"
