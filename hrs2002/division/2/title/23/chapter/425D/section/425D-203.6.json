The application shall:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tRecite the name of the limited partnership and the effective date of its involuntary cancellation;\n\t(2)\tState that all delinquent annual statements have been filed and that all delinquent fees, penalties, assessments, and costs have been paid; and\n\t(3)\tContain a certificate from the department of taxation reciting that all taxes owed by the limited partnership have been paid.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  Within the applicable reinstatement period, should the name of the limited partnership, or a name substantially identical thereto, be registered or reserved by another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or limited liability partnership, or should such name or a name substantially identical thereto be registered as a trade name, trademark, or service mark, then reinstatement shall be allowed only upon the registration of a new name by the limited partnership pursuant to the amendment provisions of this chapter.\n\t(d)  When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the involuntary cancellation and the limited partnership may resume its business as if the involuntary cancellation had never occurred.
