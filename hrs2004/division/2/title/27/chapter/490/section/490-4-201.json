If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this Article apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.\n\t(b)  After an item has been indorsed with the words \"pay any bank\" or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tReturned to the customer initiating collection; or\n\t(2)\tSpecially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.
