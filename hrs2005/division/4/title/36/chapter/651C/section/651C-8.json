The judgment may be entered against:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe first transferee of the asset or the person for whose benefit the transfer was made; or\n\t(2)\tAny subsequent transferee other than a good-faith transferee who took for value or from any subsequent transferee.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  If the judgment under subsection (b) is based upon the value of the asset transferred, the judgment must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer, subject to adjustment as the equities may require.\n\t(d)  Notwithstanding voidability of a transfer or an obligation under this chapter, a good-faith transferee or obligee is entitled, to the extent of the value given the debtor for the transfer or obligation, to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tA lien on or a right to retain any interest in the asset transferred;\n\t(2)\tEnforcement of any obligation incurred; or\n\t(3)\tA reduction in the amount of the liability on the judgment.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  A transfer is not voidable under section 651C-4(a)(2) or section 651C-5 if the transfer results from:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tTermination of a lease upon default by the debtor when the termination is pursuant to the lease and applicable law; or\n\t(2)\tEnforcement of a security interest in compliance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\n\n\n\t(f)  A transfer is not voidable under section 651C-5(b):\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tTo the extent the insider gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor after the transfer was made unless the new value was secured by a valid lien;\n\t(2)\tIf made in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the insider; or\n\t(3)\tIf made pursuant to a good-faith effort to rehabilitate the debtor and the transfer secured present value given for that purpose as well as an antecedent debt of the debtor.
