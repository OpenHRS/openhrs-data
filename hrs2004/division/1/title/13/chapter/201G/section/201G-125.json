    "text": "(a)  The corporation shall sell completed dwelling units or dwelling units that are substantially completed and habitable, developed and constructed hereunder, to qualified residents in fee simple, or shall cause them to be leased or rented to qualified residents, at a price or rental based on costs as determined by the corporation.  The gross share to the other partners or contract payments and any amounts subsidized by the State, including but not limited to the land, need not be counted as cost so as to increase the price.  Such may be borne by the State, under rules subject to reimbursement upon sale as provided for in section 201G-127.\n\t(b)  If a qualified purchaser is unable to obtain sufficient funds at reasonable rates from private lenders, the corporation, by way of mortgage, agreement of sale, or other instrument to secure the indebtedness, may loan to the purchaser up to one hundred per cent of the purchase price.  The purchaser in that event shall execute with the corporation an agreement of sale or mortgage or other instrument under the terms of which the unpaid principal and the interest thereon shall be paid in monthly installments over a period of not more than forty years.\n\t(c)  Every mortgage, agreement of sale, other instrument to secure the indebtedness, or instrument of indebtedness executed by the corporation may contain other provisions as are usually found in such instruments and shall provide that the purchaser may repay the whole or any part of the unpaid balance of the purchase price plus accrued interest at any time without prepayment penalty.\n\t(d)  If the purchaser defaults on the payment of any loan, the corporation shall take all necessary action to collect the delinquent principal and interest on the loan and may take all actions allowed to holders of obligations, including the power to repossess, lease, rent, repair, renovate, modernize, and sell the property foreclosed, subject to the restrictions hereinafter described.\n\t(e)  The mortgages, agreements of sale, and other instruments of indebtedness, at the direction of the corporation, may be assigned to and serviced by commercial banks and other lending institutions doing business in the State at a fee of not more than one-half of one per cent of the amount loaned to the purchaser.\n\t(f)  Subsections (a) to (e) need not apply to market-priced units in an economically integrated housing project, except as otherwise determined by the developer of the units; provided that preference shall be given to qualified residents in the initial sale of market-priced units.
