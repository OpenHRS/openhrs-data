    "text": "(a)  If there are more ballots than the poll book indicates, this shall be an overage and if less ballots, it shall be an underage.  The election officials or counting center employees responsible for the tabulation of ballots shall make a note of this fact on a form to be provided by the chief election officer.  The form recording the overage or underage shall be sent directly to the chief election officer or the clerk in county elections separate and apart from the other election records. \t(b)  If the electronic voting system is being used in an election, the overage or underage shall be recorded after the tabulation of the ballots.  In an election using the paper ballot voting system, the precinct officials shall proceed to count the votes cast for each candidate or on a question after recording the overage or underage.\n\t(c)  The chief election officer or the clerk shall make a list of all precincts in which an overage or underage occurred and the amount of the overage or underage.  This list shall be filed and kept as a public record in the office of the chief election officer or the clerk in county elections and the clerk's office in counties other than the city and county of Honolulu in elections involving state candidates.\n\tAn election contest may be brought under part XI, if the overage or underage in any district could affect the outcome of an election.
