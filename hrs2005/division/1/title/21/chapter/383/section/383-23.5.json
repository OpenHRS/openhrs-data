For this paragraph to apply, the services performed for the employer by the individual in the base period (or remuneration for the services) must affect eligibility for, or increase the amount of the pension; and\n\t(2)\tParagraph (1) shall not apply to any pension if the individual has made any contribution to the plan maintained by the base period or chargeable employer.\n\n\n\n\t(e)  Notwithstanding any provision under this section, the amount of any pension, retirement or retired pay, annuity, or other similar periodic payment under the Social Security Act or the Railroad Act of 1974 shall not result in a reduction of the weekly benefit amount payable to an individual under this section.
