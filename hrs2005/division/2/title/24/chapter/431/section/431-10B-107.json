The copy of the application for, or notice of proposed insurance, shall also refer exclusively to insurance coverage and shall be separate and apart from the loan, sale or other credit statement of account, instrument or agreement, unless the information required by this section is prominently set forth therein.  Upon acceptance of the insurance by the insurer and within thirty days of the date upon which the indebtedness is incurred, the insurer shall cause the individual policy or group certificate of insurance to be delivered to the debtor.  The application or notice of proposed insurance shall state that upon acceptance by the insurer, the insurance shall become effective as provided in section 431:10B-106.\n\t(f)  If the named insurer does not accept the risk, the debtor shall receive a policy or certificate of insurance setting forth the name and home office address of the substituted insurer and the amount of the premium to be charged, and if the amount of premium is less than that set forth in the notice of proposed insurance, an appropriate refund shall be made.
