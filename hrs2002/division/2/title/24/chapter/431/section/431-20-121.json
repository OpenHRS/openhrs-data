Each filing shall be accompanied by a $20 fee payable to the commissioner, which fee shall be deposited in the commissioner's education and training fund.\n\t(b)  The commissioner may disapprove any such form if it:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tIs in violation of law;\n\t(2)\tContains inconsistent, ambiguous or misleading clauses, or exceptions and conditions which deceptively affect the risk purported to be assumed in the general coverage of the contract;\n\t(3)\tHas any title, heading or other indication of its provisions which is misleading; or\n\t(4)\tIs printed or otherwise reproduced in such manner as to render any material provision of the form substantially illegible.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  The commissioner shall not disapprove any such form after expiration of the initial thirty-day advance filing period except after a hearing thereon held in accordance with chapter 91.\n\t(d)  A title insurer shall not use in this State any form while it is so disapproved by the commissioner.
