    "text": "In anticipation of the issuance under this part of revenue bonds theretofore authorized by the legislature and of the receipt of the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the board shall have power, with the approval of the governor, to issue and sell bond anticipation notes for the purposes for which such bonds have been authorized, the maximum principal amount of which notes shall not exceed the authorized principal amount of such bonds.  The notes shall be payable solely from and secured solely by the proceeds of the sale of the bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued and the revenues from which would be payable and by which would be secured such bonds; provided that to the extent the principal of the notes is paid from moneys other than the proceeds of sale of such bonds, the maximum amount of bonds in anticipation of which the notes are issued that has been authorized shall be reduced by the amount of such notes paid in such manner.  The issuance of such notes and the details thereof shall be governed by the provisions of this part with respect to bonds insofar as the same may be applicable; provided that (1) each note, together with all renewals and extensions thereof, or refundings thereof by other notes issued under this section, shall mature within five years from the date of the original note, and (2) the notes may be sold at public or private sale, as the board, with the approval of the governor, may determine.
