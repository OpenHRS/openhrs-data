[L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-204; HRS \u00a7490:4-204; am L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None; but see Section 6, American Bankers Association Bank Collection Code.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) prescribes the general standards applicable to proper sending or forwarding of items.\u00a0 Because of the many types of methods available and the desirability of preserving flexibility any attempt to prescribe limited or precise methods is avoided.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 Subsection (2)(a) codifies the practice of direct mail, express, messenger or like presentment to payor banks.\u00a0 The practice is now country-wide and is justified by the need for speed, the general responsibility of banks, Federal Deposit Insurance protection and other reasons.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Full approval of the practice of direct sending is limited to cases where a bank is a payor.\u00a0 Where non-bank drawees or payors may be of unknown responsibility, substantial risks may be attached to placing in their hands the instruments calling for payments from them.\u00a0 This is obviously so in the case of documentary drafts.\u00a0 However, in some cities practices have long existed under clearing house procedures to forward certain types of items to certain non-bank payors.\u00a0 Examples include insurance loss drafts drawn by field agents on home offices.\u00a0 For the purpose of leaving the door open to legitimate practices of this kind, subsection (2)(c) affirmatively approves direct sending of any item other than documentary drafts to any non-bank payor, if authorized by Federal Reserve regulation or operating letter, clearing house rule or the like.\n\u00a0 On the other hand subsection (2)(b) approves sending any item direct to a non-bank payor if authorized by a collecting bank's transferor.\u00a0 This permits special instructions or agreements out of the norm and is consistent with the \"chain of command\" theory of Section 4-203.\u00a0 However, if a transferor other than the owner of the item, e.g., a prior collecting bank, authorizes a direct sending to a nonbank payor, such transferor assumes responsibility for the propriety or impropriety of such authorization.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 Section 3-504 states how presentment is made and subsection (2) of that Section affirmatively approves three specific methods by which presentment may be made.\u00a0 The methods so specified are permissive and do not foreclose other possible methods.\u00a0 However, in view of the substantial increase in recent years of presentment at centralized bookkeeping centers and electronic processing centers maintained or used by payor banks, many of which are at locations other than the banks themselves, subsection (3) specifically approves presentment by a presenting bank at any place requested by the payor bank.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Sections 3-504, 4-501 and 4-502.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Documentary draft\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Item\".\u00a0 Section 4-104.\n\u00a0 \"Payor bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105.\n\u00a0 \"Presenting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105."
