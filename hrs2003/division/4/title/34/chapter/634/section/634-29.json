But in all cases where a writ of attachment is issued in accordance with chapter 651 relating to attachments, and the defendant in attachment was never a resident of the State or has departed from the State or secretes oneself so that the writ of attachment cannot be personally served upon the defendant, personal service of the writ upon the defendant may be dispensed with.  All after-leases, mortgages, sales, devises, assignments, trusts, or other conveyances of the property, until the dissolution of the process, shall be void in law as against the plaintiff in such cases.
