    "text": "If a draft or the relevant instructions require presentment \"on arrival\", \"when goods arrive\" or the like, the collecting bank need not present until in its judgment a reasonable time for arrival of the goods has expired.\u00a0 Refusal to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank must notify its transferor of the refusal but need not present the draft again until it is instructed to do so or learns of the arrival of the goods. [L 1965, c 208, \u00a74-502; HRS ; am L 1991, c 118, pt of \u00a74]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 The section is designed to establish a definite rule for \"on arrival\" drafts.\u00a0 The term includes not only drafts drawn payable \"on arrival\" but also drafts forwarded with instructions to present \"on arrival\".\u00a0 The term refers to the arrival of the relevant goods.\u00a0 Unless a bank has actual knowledge of the arrival of the goods, as for example, when it is the \"notify\" party on the bill of lading, the section only requires the exercise of such judgment in estimating time as a bank may be expected to have.\u00a0 Commonly the buyer-drawee will want the goods and will therefore call for the documents and take up the draft when they do arrive.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 In Article 4:\u00a0 Sections 4-202 and 4-203.\n\u00a0 In Article 5:\u00a0 Section 5-112.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Collecting bank\".\u00a0 Section 4-105."
