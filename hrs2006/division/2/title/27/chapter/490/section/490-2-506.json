[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-506; HRS \u00a7490:2-506; am L 2004, c 163, \u00a711]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 None.\n\u00a0 Purposes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 \"Financing agency\" is broadly defined in this Article to cover every normal instance in which a party aids or intervenes in the financing of a sales transaction.\u00a0 The term as used in subsection (1) is not in any sense intended as a limitation and covers any other appropriate situation which may arise outside the scope of the definition.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 \"Paying\" as used in subsection (1) is typified by the letter of credit, or \"authority to pay\" situation in which a banker, by arrangement with the buyer or other consignee, pays on his behalf a draft for the price of the goods.\u00a0 It is immaterial whether the draft is formally drawn on the party paying or his principal, whether it is a sight draft paid in cash or a time draft \"paid\" in the first instance by acceptance, or whether the payment is viewed as absolute or conditional.\u00a0 All of these cases constitute \"payment\" under this subsection.\u00a0 Similarly, \"purchasing for value\" is used to indicate the whole area of financing by the seller's banker, and the principle of subsection (1) is applicable without any niceties of distinction between \"purchase,\" \"discount,\" \"advance against collection\" or the like.\u00a0 But it is important to notice that the only right to have the draft honored that is acquired is that against the buyer; if any right against any one else is claimed it will have to be under some separate obligation of that other person.\u00a0 A letter of credit does not necessarily protect purchasers of drafts.\u00a0 See Article 5.\u00a0 And for the relations of the parties to documentary drafts see Part 5 of Article 4.\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 Subsection (1) is made applicable to payments or advances against a draft which \"relates to\" a shipment of goods and this has been chosen as a term of maximum breadth.\u00a0 In particular the term is intended to cover the case of a draft against an invoice or against a delivery order.\u00a0 Further, it is unnecessary that there be an explicit assignment of the invoice attached to the draft to bring the transaction within the reason of this subsection.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 After shipment, \"the rights of the shipper in the goods\" are merely security rights and are subject to the buyer's right to force delivery upon tender of the price.\u00a0 The rights acquired by the financing agency are similarly limited and, moreover, if the agency fails to procure any outstanding negotiable document of title, it may find its exercise of these rights hampered or even defeated by the seller's disposition of the document to a third party.\u00a0 This section does not attempt to create any new rights in the financing agency against the carrier which would force the latter to honor a stop order from the agency, a stranger to the shipment, or any new rights against a holder to whom a document of title has been duly negotiated under Article 7.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 2-104(2) and Article 4.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Part 5 of Article 4, and Article 5.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Sections 2-501 and 2-502(1) and Article 7.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Document of title\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Draft\".\u00a0 Section 3-104.\n\u00a0 \"Financing agency\".\u00a0 Section 2-104.\n\u00a0 \"Good faith\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Honor\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Purchase\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Rights\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Value\".\u00a0 Section 1-201."
