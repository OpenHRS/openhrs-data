    "number": "111",
    "text": "Although a prosecution is for a violation of a different statutory provision or is based on different facts, it is barred by a former prosecution under any of the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe former prosecution resulted in an acquittal which has not subsequently been set aside or in a conviction as defined in section 701-110(3) and the subsequent prosecution is for:\n\n\t\t(a)\tAny offense of which the defendant could have been convicted on the first prosecution; or\n\t\t(b)\tAny offense for which the defendant should have been tried on the first prosecution under section 701-109 unless the court ordered a separate trial of the offense; or\n\t\t(c)\tAn offense based on the same conduct, unless:\n\n\t\t\t(i)\tThe offense for which the defendant is subsequently prosecuted requires proof of a fact not required by the former offense and the law defining each of the offenses is intended to prevent a substantially different harm or evil; or\n\t\t\t(ii)\tThe second offense was not consummated when the former trial began.\n\n\n\n\t(2)\tThe former prosecution was terminated by an acquittal or by a final order or judgment for the defendant which has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated and which acquittal, final order, or judgment necessarily required a determination inconsistent with a fact which must be established for conviction of the second offense.\n\t(3)\tThe former prosecution was improperly terminated, as improper termination is defined in section 701-110(4), and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted had the former prosecution not been improperly terminated. [L 1972, c 9, pt of \u00a71]"
