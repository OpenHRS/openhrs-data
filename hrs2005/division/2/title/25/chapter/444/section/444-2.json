    "text": "This chapter shall not apply to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tOfficers and employees of the United States, the State, or any county while in the performance of their governmental duties;\n\t(2)\tAny person acting as a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, personal representative, or any other person acting under any order or authorization of any court;\n\t(3)\tA person who sells or installs any finished products, materials, or articles of merchandise that are not actually fabricated into and do not become a permanent fixed part of the structure, or to the construction, alteration, improvement, or repair of personal property;\n\t(4)\tAny project or operation for which the aggregate contract price for labor, materials, taxes, and all other items is not more than $1,000.  This exemption shall not apply in any case where a building permit is required regardless of the aggregate contract price, nor where the undertaking is only a part of a larger or major project or operation, whether undertaken by the same or a different contractor or in which a division of the project or operation is made in contracts of amounts not more than $1,000 for the purpose of evading this chapter or otherwise;\n\t(5)\tA registered architect or professional engineer acting solely in the person's professional capacity;\n\t(6)\tAny person who engages in the activities regulated in this chapter as an employee with wages as the person's sole compensation;\n\t(7)\tOwners or lessees of property who build or improve residential, farm, industrial, or commercial buildings or structures on property for their own use, or for use by their grandparents, parents, siblings, or children and who do not offer the buildings or structures for sale or lease; provided that this exemption shall not apply to electrical or plumbing work that must be performed only by persons or entities licensed under this chapter, or to the owner or lessee of the property if the owner or lessee is licensed under chapter 448E.  In all actions brought under this paragraph, proof of the sale or lease, or offering for sale or lease, of the structure not more than one year after completion is prima facie evidence that the construction or improvement of the structure was undertaken for the purpose of sale or lease; provided that this provision shall not apply to residential properties sold or leased to employees of the owner or lessee; provided further that in order to qualify for this exemption the owner or lessee must register for the exemptions as provided in section 444-9.1.  Any owner or lessee of property found to have violated this paragraph shall not be permitted to engage in any activities pursuant to this paragraph or to register under section 444-9.1 for a period of three years.  There is a presumption that an owner or lessee has violated this section, when the owner or lessee obtains an exemption from the licensing requirements of section 444-9 more than once in two years;\n\t(8)\tAny joint venture if all members thereof hold licenses issued under this chapter;\n\t(9)\tAny project or operation where it is determined by the board that less than ten persons are qualified to perform the work in question and that the work does not pose a potential danger to public health, safety, and welfare; or\n\t(10)\tAny public works project that requires additional qualifications beyond those established by the licensing law and which is deemed necessary and in the public interest by the contracting agency.

Supp. 2d 1133.\n  Promise by defendant to pay plaintiff for work performed and moneys expended established an employment relationship and took matter outside of chapter under paragraph (7).  58 H. 257, 567 P.2d 824.\n  While a member of the public who violates the owner-builder exemption under paragraph (7) (1993) by selling or leasing the subject property within one year of completion is subject to the sanctions imposed under paragraph (7), that party is not precluded from enforcing the underlying contract with an unlicensed contractor.   92 H. 117 (App.), 987 P.2d 1015."
