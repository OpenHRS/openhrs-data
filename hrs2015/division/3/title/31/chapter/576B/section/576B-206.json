[L 1997, c 295, pt of \u00a71]\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Where New Mexico had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its spousal support order, New Mexico could act as a responding tribunal to enforce or modify its order; husband and wife were subject to the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of New Mexico notwithstanding the fact that neither resided in New Mexico; because Hawaii lacked continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over New Mexico's spousal support order, Hawaii could not serve as a responding tribunal to modify New Mexico's spousal support order, but could enforce it.\u00a0 111 H. 51 (App.), 137 P.3d 365 (2006)."
