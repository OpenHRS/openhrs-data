If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual's \"heirs\", \"heirs at law\", \"next of kin\", \"relatives\", or \"family\", or language of similar import, the property passes to those persons, including the State, and in such shares as would succeed to the designated individual's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the designated individual's domicile if the designated individual died when the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment.  If the designated individual's surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is living but is remarried or has terminated the reciprocal beneficiary relationship at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, the surviving spouse or reciprocal beneficiary is not an heir of the designated individual.
