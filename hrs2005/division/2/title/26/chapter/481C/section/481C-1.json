If in the course of such a visit, the seller sells the buyer the right to receive additional services or goods other than replacement parts necessarily used in performing the maintenance or in making the repairs, the sale of those additional goods or services would not fall within this exclusion. \n\n\n\n\t(2)\t\"Goods\" means all chattels personal, other than money and things in action, except as herein provided, and includes emblements, growing crops, and things which attach to or form a part of land which are agreed to be severed before sale under the contract and things which at the time of sale or subsequently are to be so affixed to real property as to become a part thereof, whether or not severable therefrom.  The term includes merchandise certificates or coupons, issued by a seller, to be used in their face amount in lieu of cash in exchange for goods sold by such a seller.  The term also includes services as herein defined. \n\t(3)\t\"Services\" means work, labor, or service of any kind whether purchased primarily for personal, family or household use, and whether or not furnished in connection with the delivery, installation, servicing, repair, or improvement of goods, and includes repairs, alterations, or improvements upon or in connection with real property. \n\t(4)\t\"Seller\" means any person, partnership, corporation, association, or other group, however organized, engaged in the door-to-door sale of goods or services. \n\t(5)\t\"Sale\" means and includes any sale with a purchase price of $5 or more, or $25 if the merchandise is capable of being delivered at one time, other than for resale, of goods to a buyer pursuant to a contract.
