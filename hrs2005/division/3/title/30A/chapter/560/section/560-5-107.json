    "text": "(a)  After the appointment of a guardian or conservator or entry of any other protective order, the court making the appointment or entering the order may transfer the proceeding to a court in another circuit in this State or to another state if the court is satisfied that a transfer will serve the best interest of the ward or protected person.\n\t(b)  If a guardianship or protective proceeding is pending in another state or a foreign country and a petition for guardianship or protective proceeding is filed in a court in this State, the court in this State shall notify the original court and, after consultation with the original court, assume or decline jurisdiction, whichever is in the best interest of the ward or protected person.\n\t(c)  A guardian, conservator, or like fiduciary appointed in another state may petition the court for appointment as a guardian or conservator in this State if venue in this State is or will be established.  The appointment may be made upon proof of appointment in the other state and presentation of a certified copy of the portion of the court record in the other state specified by the court in this State.  Notice of hearing on the petition, together with a copy of the petition, shall be given to the ward or protected person, if the ward or protected person has attained fourteen years of age, and to the persons who would be entitled to notice if the regular procedures for appointment of a guardian or conservator under this article were applicable.  The court shall make the appointment in this State unless it concludes that the appointment would not be in the best interest of the ward or protected person.  Upon the filing of an acceptance of office and any required bond, the court shall issue appropriate letters of guardianship or conservatorship.  Within fourteen days after an appointment, the guardian or conservator shall send or deliver a copy of the order of appointment to the ward or protected person, if the ward or protected person has attained fourteen years of age, and to all persons given notice of the hearing on the petition.
