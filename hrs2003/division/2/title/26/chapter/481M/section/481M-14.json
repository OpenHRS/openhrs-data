If the agreement involves a lease of two or more items as a set, in one agreement, a statement of the aggregate cash price of all items is sufficient;\n\t(7)\tThe total of initial payments paid or required at or before consummation of the agreement or delivery of the property whichever is later;\n\t(8)\tA statement that the total of payments shall not include other charges, such as delivery, taxes, late payment, pickup, and reinstatement fees, which fees shall be separately disclosed in the contract;\n\t(9)\tA statement clearly summarizing the terms of the lessee's option to purchase, including a statement that the lessee has the right to exercise an early-purchase option and the price, formula, or method for determining the price at which the property may be so purchased;\n\t(10)\tA statement identifying the party responsible for maintaining or servicing the property while it is being leased, together with a description of that responsibility, and a statement that if any part of a manufacturer's express warranty covers the leased property at the time the lessee acquires ownership of the property, the warranty shall be transferred to the lessee, if allowed by the terms of the warranty;\n\t(11)\tThe date of the transaction and the identities of the lessor and lessee;\n\t(12)\tA statement that the lessee may terminate the agreement without penalty by voluntarily surrendering or returning the property in good repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, upon expiration of any lease term along with any past due rental payments; and\n\t(13)\tNotice of the right to reinstate an agreement as provided in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\t(b)  In addition to the disclosures required pursuant to this section, the lessor shall also make the following disclosure:\nNOTICE TO LESSEE--READ BEFORE SIGNING\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tDO NOT SIGN THIS BEFORE YOU READ THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT INCLUDING ANY WRITING ON THE REVERSE SIDE, EVEN IF OTHERWISE ADVISED.\n\t(2)\tDO NOT SIGN THIS IF IT CONTAINS ANY BLANK SPACES.\n\t(3)\tYOU ARE ENTITLED TO AN EXACT COPY OF ANY AGREEMENT YOU SIGN.\n\t(4)\tYOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ANY EARLY BUY-OUT OPTION AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  EXERCISE OF THIS OPTION MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF YOUR TOTAL COST TO ACQUIRE OWNERSHIP UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n\t(5)\tIF YOU ELECT TO MAKE WEEKLY RATHER THAN MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND EXERCISE YOUR PURCHASE OPTION, YOU MAY PAY MORE FOR THE LEASED PROPERTY.\n\n\n\n\t(c)  With respect to matters specifically governed by the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 to 1674), compliance with that Act satisfies the requirements of this section.
