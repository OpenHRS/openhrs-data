App. 148, 861 P.2d 759.\n  Where the indictment alleges that a \"dangerous instrument\" was used in the commission of the offense charged so as to allow proof that a \"firearm\" was used, the possibility exists that the defendant is not eligible for a deferred acceptance of no contest (DANC) plea; in such cases, if prior to the court's decision on the defendant's motion for a DANC plea the court is informed that the \"dangerous instrument\" was a \"firearm\", the defendant is not eligible for, and the court is not authorized to enter, a DANC plea.  101 H. 65 (App.), 62 P.3d 628.\n  Mentioned:  74 H. 75, 837 P.2d 776.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAPPENDIX\n\n\u00a0\n1.
