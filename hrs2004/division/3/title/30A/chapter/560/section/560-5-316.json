However, the appointment of a guardian automatically terminates the authority of any agent designated in the medical directive or health care power of attorney.\n\t(d)  A guardian shall not initiate the commitment of a ward to a mental health-care institution except in accordance with the State's procedure for involuntary civil commitment.
