    "text": "(a)  Agencies shall maximize their use of available alternative financing contracting mechanisms, including energy-savings performance contracts and utility energy-efficiency service contracts, when life-cycle cost-effective, to reduce energy use and cost in their facilities and operations.  Energy-savings performance contracts and utility energy-efficiency service contracts shall provide significant opportunities for making state facilities more energy efficient at no net cost to taxpayers.\n\t(b)  Agencies that perform energy efficiency and renewable energy system retrofitting may continue to receive budget appropriations for energy expenditures at an amount that will not fall below the pre-retrofitting energy budget but will rise in proportion to any increase in the agency's overall budget for the duration of the performance contract or project payment term.  A portion of the moneys saved through efficiency and renewable energy system retrofitting shall be set aside to pay for any costs directly associated with administering energy efficiency and renewable energy system retrofitting programs incurred by the agency.\n\t(c)  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary relating to the award of public contracts, any agency desiring to enter into an energy performance contract shall do so in accordance with the following provisions:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe agency shall issue a public request for proposals, advertised in the same manner as provided in chapter 103D, concerning the provision of energy efficiency services or the design, installation, operation, and maintenance of energy equipment, or both.  The request for proposals shall contain terms and conditions relating to submission of proposals, evaluation, and selection of proposals, financial terms, legal responsibilities, and other matters as may be required by law and as the agency determines appropriate;\n\t(2)\tUpon receiving responses to the request for proposals, the agency may select the most qualified proposal or proposals on the basis of the experience and qualifications of the proposers, the technical approach, the financial arrangements, the overall benefits to the agency, and other factors determined by the agency to be relevant and appropriate;\n\t(3)\tThe agency thereafter may negotiate and enter into an energy performance contract with the person or company whose proposal is selected as the most qualified based on the criteria established by the agency;\n\t(4)\tThe term of any energy performance contract entered into pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifteen years;\n\t(5)\tAny energy performance contract may provide that the agency ultimately shall receive title to the energy system being financed under the contract; and\n\t(6)\tAny energy performance contract shall provide that total payments shall not exceed total savings.
