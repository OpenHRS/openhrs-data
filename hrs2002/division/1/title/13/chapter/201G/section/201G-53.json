    "text": "  (a)  Where the corporation proposes to terminate a lease, rental agreement, permit, or license, and evict a tenant, licensee, or other occupant under section 201G-52, a hearing shall be held to determine whether cause exists for the action.  The corporation shall give written notice to the person concerned specifying the reason for which the eviction is proposed and fixing the date and place of hearing.  The written notice shall further inform the tenant, licensee, or other occupant of the right to inspect and copy the tenant file at the tenant's expense before the hearing is held.  The notice shall be given at least five days before the date set for the hearing.  At the hearing, before final action is taken, the person concerned shall be entitled to be heard in person or through counsel, and shall be accorded a full and fair hearing in accordance with the requirements of a contested case hearing provided for under sections 91-9 and 91-10 to 91-13.  This full and fair hearing shall be deemed to be a contested case hearing before the agency that is required pursuant to chapter 91.\n\t(b)  Hearings shall be conducted by an eviction board appointed by the corporation.  The eviction board shall consist of not fewer than three persons, of which one member shall be a tenant.  At least one eviction board shall be established in each county of the State.  The findings, conclusions, decision, and order of the eviction board shall be final unless an appeal is taken as hereinafter provided.\n\t(c)  The eviction board shall have the same powers respecting administering oaths, compelling the attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence, and examining witnesses, as are possessed by circuit courts.  In case of disobedience by any person of any order of the eviction board, or of any subpoena issued by the eviction board, or the refusal of any witness to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may lawfully be questioned, any circuit judge, on application by the eviction board, shall compel obedience as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued by a circuit court, or a refusal to testify therein.
