    "text": "(a)  Where an employee is absent from work because of injuries incurred within the scope of the employee's employment and the employee is receiving workers' compensation benefits, the employee shall continue to earn vacation, sick leave, and retirement credits as though the employee were not absent but performing duties of the employee's regular employment.  Section 386-57 or any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the employee may elect to have deducted from the employee's workers' compensation benefit checks an amount calculated in the same manner as if the employee were not absent but performing duties of the employee's regular employment to be used as the employee's contribution to the retirement system.\n\t(b)  An employee who is receiving workers' compensation wage loss replacement benefits may use the employee's accumulated sick leave or vacation credits to supplement the workers' compensation wage loss replacement benefits to a sum not to exceed the employee's regular salary.
