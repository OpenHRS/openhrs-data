Registration under this subsection is for the purpose of providing the covered offender's photograph, fingerprints, and registration information.  Registration under this subsection is required whenever the covered offender, whether or not a resident of this State, remains in this State for more than ten days or for an aggregate period exceeding thirty days in one calendar year.  Covered offenders required to register in person with the chief of police under this subsection shall register no later than three working days after:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tArrival in this State;\n\t(2)\tRelease from incarceration;\n\t(3)\tRelease from commitment;\n\t(4)\tRelease on furlough;\n\t(5)\tPlacement on parole; or\n\t(6)\tArrival in a county in which the covered offender resides or expects to be present for a period exceeding ten days.\n\n\n\nIn addition to any other requirement to register under this subsection or subsection (a), each covered offender shall report in person every five years to the chief of police where the covered offender resides for purposes of having a new photograph taken.\n\t(f)  The registration provisions of this section shall apply to all covered offenders without regard to:\n\n\n\n\t(1)\tThe date of the covered offender's conviction;\n\t(2)\tThe date of finding, pursuant to chapter 704, of the covered offender's unfitness to proceed; or\n\t(3)\tThe date of the covered offender's acquittal due to mental disease, disorder, or defect, pursuant to chapter 704.  [L 1997, c 316, pt of \u00a72; am L 1998, c 194, \u00a72; am L 2002, c 234, \u00a71; am L 2003, c 62, \u00a74; am L 2004, c 59, \u00a72; am L 2005, c 45, \u00a74]\n\n\n\n\nCase Notes\n  As the registration requirements of chapter 846E do not interfere with any of a sex offender's protected liberty interests, the protections of procedural due process are not triggered.  97 H. 285, 36 P.3d 1255.\n  The lifetime registration component of the Hawaii sex offender registration statute implicates a protected liberty interest under the Hawaii constitution, article I, \u00a75 and requires that minimum requirements of due process--notice and opportunity to be heard--be afforded to convicted sex offenders; such a proceeding may be instituted by a sex offender in a special proceeding.  105 H. 222, 96 P.3d 242."
