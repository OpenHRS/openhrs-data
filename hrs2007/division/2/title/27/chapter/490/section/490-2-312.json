[L 1965, c 208, \u00a72-312; HRS \u00a7490:2-312]\n\u00a0\nCOMMENTS TO OFFICIAL TEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:\u00a0 Section 13, Uniform Sales Act.\n\u00a0 Changes:\u00a0 Completely rewritten, the provisions concerning infringement being new.\n\u00a0 Purposes of Changes:\n\u00a0 1.\u00a0 Subsection (1) makes provision for a buyer's basic needs in respect to a title which he in good faith expects to acquire by his purchase, namely, that he receive a good, clean title transferred to him also in a rightful manner so that he will not be exposed to a lawsuit in order to protect it.\n\u00a0 The warranty extends to a buyer whether or not the seller was in possession of the goods at the time the sale or contract to sell was made.\n\u00a0 The warranty of quiet possession is abolished.\u00a0 Disturbance of quiet possession, although not mentioned specifically, is one way, among many, in which the breach of the warranty of title may be established.\n\u00a0 The \"knowledge\" referred to in subsection 1(b) is actual knowledge as distinct from notice.\n\u00a0 2.\u00a0 The provisions of this Article requiring notification to the seller within a reasonable time after the buyer's discovery of a breach apply to notice of a breach of the warranty of title, where the seller's breach was innocent.\u00a0 However, if the seller's breach was in bad faith he cannot be permitted to claim that he has been misled or prejudiced by the delay in giving notice.\u00a0 In such case the \"reasonable\" time for notice should receive a very liberal interpretation.\u00a0 Whether the breach by the seller is in good or bad faith Section 2-725 provides that the cause of action accrues when the breach occurs.\u00a0 Under the provisions of that section the breach of the warranty of good title occurs when tender of delivery is made since the warranty is not one which extends to \"future performance of the goods.\"\n\u00a0 3.\u00a0 When the goods are part of the seller's normal stock and are sold in his normal course of business, it is his duty to see that no claim of infringement of a patent or trademark by a third party will mar the buyer's title.\u00a0 A sale by a person other than a dealer, however, raises no implication in its circumstances of such a warranty.\u00a0 Nor is there such an implication when the buyer orders goods to be assembled, prepared or manufactured on his own specifications.\u00a0 If, in such a case, the resulting product infringes a patent or trademark, the liability will run from buyer to seller.\u00a0 There is, under such circumstances, a tacit representation on the part of the buyer that the seller will be safe in manufacturing according to the specifications, and the buyer is under an obligation in good faith to indemnify him for any loss suffered.\n\u00a0 4.\u00a0 This section rejects the cases which recognize the principle that infringements violate the warranty of title but deny the buyer a remedy unless he has been expressly prevented from using the goods.\u00a0 Under this Article \"eviction\" is not a necessary condition to the buyer's remedy since the buyer's remedy arises immediately upon receipt of notice of infringement; it is merely one way of establishing the fact of breach.\n\u00a0 5.\u00a0 Subsection (2) recognizes that sales by sheriffs, executors, foreclosing lienors and persons similarly situated are so out of the ordinary commercial course that their peculiar character is immediately apparent to the buyer and therefore no personal obligation is imposed upon the seller who is purporting to sell only an unknown or limited right.\u00a0 This subsection does not touch upon and leaves open all questions of restitution arising in such cases, when a unique article so sold is reclaimed by a third party as the rightful owner.\n\u00a0 6.\u00a0 The warranty of subsection (1) is not designated as an \"implied\" warranty, and hence is not subject to Section 2-316(3).\u00a0 Disclaimer of the warranty of title is governed instead by subsection (2), which requires either specific language or the described circumstances.\n\u00a0 Cross References:\n\u00a0 Point 1:\u00a0 Section 2-403.\n\u00a0 Point 2:\u00a0 Sections 2-607 and 2-725.\n\u00a0 Point 3:\u00a0 Section 1-203.\n\u00a0 Point 4:\u00a0 Sections 2-609 and 2-725.\n\u00a0 Point 6:\u00a0 Section 2-316.\n\u00a0 Definitional Cross References:\n\u00a0 \"Buyer\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0 \"Contract for sale\".\u00a0 Section 2-106.\n\u00a0 \"Goods\".\u00a0 Section 2-105.\n\u00a0 \"Person\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Right\".\u00a0 Section 1-201.\n\u00a0 \"Seller\".\u00a0 Section 2-103.\n\u00a0\nCase Notes\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Subsection (2) cited with respect to sale of a motor vehicle.\u00a0 2 H. App. 308, 631 P.2d 594.\n\u00a0 Seller without title to vehicle not precluded from being a \"seller\".\u00a0 4 H. App. 265, 664 P.2d 755."
