All notices, orders, and process of the court may run into any judicial circuit and be returnable as the court may direct.\n\tThe procedure shall conform as near as may be to the practice in the circuit courts, but subject to the express provisions of this chapter and to general laws and rules of court.  Forms prescribed by the court before taking effect shall be approved by the supreme court.\n\tUpon demand for jury trial, issues shall be framed therefor by the circuit judge to whom the case has been assigned.
