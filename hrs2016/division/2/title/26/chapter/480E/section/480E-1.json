    "text": "The purpose of this chapter is to protect Hawaii consumers from persons who prey on homeowners who face property foreclosures, liens, or encumbrances.\u00a0 Consumers who face foreclosures, liens, or encumbrances are often in desperate financial situations that can have severe adverse consequences for individuals and families even if the consumers have significant equity in their residential real property.\u00a0 The consumers' desperation makes them vulnerable to persons who claim they can stop, prevent, or delay foreclosures, liens, or encumbrances.\u00a0 Persons who make these claims often use the consumers' desperation to foster unequal bargaining positions and withhold or misrepresent vital information and details.\u00a0 As a result, consumers may be convinced to give up their real property interests and valuable equity to these persons while receiving little in return.\u00a0 Requiring full and complete disclosure of vital information will better enable consumers to make informed decisions when dealing with persons claiming to be able to stop foreclosures, liens, or encumbrances.\u00a0 This [chapter] addresses possible misrepresentations by compelling persons who offer assistance to fully and completely describe their services in written contracts and gives the homeowners the right to cancel at any time before a distressed property consultant has performed all services called for in a contract.
