Supp. 1167.\n\u00a0 Elements of harassment construed.\u00a0 60 H. 540, 592 P.2d 810.\n\u00a0 Threatening and offensive remarks directed against police afforded police probable cause to arrest for harassment.\u00a0 61 H. 291, 602 P.2d 933.\n\u00a0 Harassment is not a lesser included offense of assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7707-712.\u00a0 63 H. 1, 620 P.2d 250.\n\u00a0 Harassment not a lesser included offense of disorderly conduct.\u00a0 63 H. 548, 632 P.2d 654.\n\u00a0 Person charged with petty misdemeanor carrying maximum penalty of thirty days confinement, a fine, or both, is not entitled to jury trial.\u00a0 64 H. 374, 641 P.2d 978.\n\u00a0 Where minor's challenge to officer was not uttered in a manner likely to provoke a violent response on officer's part, there was insufficient evidence to support district family court's conclusion that minor committed offense of harassment in violation of subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 76 H. 85, 869 P.2d 1304.\n\u00a0 Because the broad language of \u00a7708-810 does not evidence an intent to confine crimes \"against a person\" to those enumerated in chapter 707, and harassment is a crime against a person, a conviction for burglary under \u00a7708-810 may be predicated on the offense of harassment.\u00a0 89 H. 284, 972 P.2d 287.\n\u00a0 An \"illegitimate purpose\" is not an element of the offense of harassment, as defined by subsection (1)(a); where substantial evidence that, after becoming angry and \"yelling\" at son, defendant slapped son in the face, trial court could reasonably have inferred that defendant intended defendant's conduct to \"annoy\" or \"alarm\" son.\u00a0 90 H. 85, 976 P.2d 399.\n\u00a0 Conviction reversed where defendant merely drove his automobile along narrow street in opposite direction from automobile of former girlfriend and did not insult, taunt, or challenge.\u00a0 7 H. App. 582, 788 P.2d 173.\n\u00a0 Record did not support a finding that defendant either insulted, taunted, or challenged dog owner, or that defendant did so in a manner likely to provoke a violent response.\u00a0 77 H. 196 (App.), 881 P.2d 1264.\n\u00a0 Where defendant came up behind victim unexpectedly and threatened victim, screamed a 10-minute tirade at victim, and were actions taken without significant provocation or cognizable justification, facts sufficient to enable a reasonable person to conclude defendant violated subsection (1)(b).\u00a0 93 H. 513 (App.), 6 P.3d 385.\n\u00a0 Defendant's conviction under this section vacated where trial court's ruling that defendant engaged in \"reckless\" conduct did not satisfy the specific intent requirement of this section.\u00a0 95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86.\n\u00a0 Under the plain meaning of subsection (1)(a), \"offensive physical contact\" encompassed the conduct of defendant knocking off police officer's hat--offensive contact that, while separate and apart from the various forms of actual bodily touching, nevertheless involved contact with an item physically appurtenant to the body.\u00a0 95 H. 290 (App.), 22 P.3d 86.\n\u00a0 Sufficient evidence supported trial court's finding that defendant committed offense of harassment.\u00a0 98 H. 459 (App.), 50 P.3d 428.\n\u00a0 Defendant's conviction of harassment under this section reversed where trial court erroneously concluded that father's actions could not be seen as reasonably necessary to protect the welfare of the recipient, and the State failed its burden of disproving beyond a reasonable doubt the justification evidence that was adduced, or proving\u00a0 beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the justification defense under \u00a7703-309.\u00a0 106 H. 252 (App.), 103 P.3d 412.\n\u00a0 Mentioned:\u00a0 9 H. App. 315, 837 P.2d 1313; 79 H. 538 (App.), 904 P.2d 552.\n\u00a0\n__________\n Commentary:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0 E.g., H.R.S. \u00a7772-2(5) and (10).\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0 H.R.S. \u00a7759-2."
